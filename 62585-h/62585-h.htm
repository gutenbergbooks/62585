<p class="ph1">MY UNCLE&#8217;S SCHEME.</p>



<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Creepmouse.</i> &#8220;In love a young man should climb&mdash;not
stoop. Yes, sir, to a young man like Tom, marriage
should be a ladder, not a pit.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Retired from Business.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle Dick amply vindicated his
brother&#8217;s eulogium of his conversational
powers. When, at the bank, I had beheld
the stout, big form of my relative,
and heard his bluff and highly familiar
language, I believed him to be as nearly
related to a boor as any man of his size
and age can be. But my opinion of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
underwent a very remarkable change when
I listened to and watched him as he sat
and talked at his brother&#8217;s dinner-table.
His manner then was perfectly polite;
positively there were certain points in his
behaviour which my father might have
beheld with envy and admiration. Added
to this, he was exceedingly well read;
talked French with a good accent, and
quoted Latin with a happy applicability
that robbed its employment of all flavour
of pedantry.</p>

<p>I had nothing to say. I was eclipsed.
His jokes kept us all in high spirits.
His anecdotes (which I can appreciate
better now than I could then) were uniformly
excellent. He appeared to know
everybody; spoke with a kind of dignified
familiarity of noblemen of reputation,
of famous actors, of celebrated authors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
He had supped with Lamb and Elliston.
He had been in Haydon&#8217;s studio when
Scott had called; he had advised Southey
on the purchase of some stocks; he had
dined with Rogers, where he had met
Sydney Smith, William Bankes, Luttrell,
and many others, whose names I forget.</p>

<p>I am very much afraid, however, that
we none of us listened to him with the
interest he deserved. Speaking for myself,
it would have given me more pleasure to
have heard an account of a champion
billiard-match or a boat-race, than the
best of Talleyrand&#8217;s mots, or the smartest
of Sydney Smith&#8217;s rejoinders. My
aunt smiled occasionally, as much out
of politeness as out of appreciation; and
uncle Tom grew so soon tired of these
stories&mdash;which I daresay he had often
heard before&mdash;that he contrived to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the conversation round to the Stock
Exchange, the income tax, and the
stamp duties, on which his brother talked
as freely and sagaciously as if these
matters had been his only studies all his
life.</p>

<p>However, don&#8217;t suppose that I sat like
a mute through that dinner. When my
uncle addressed me I contrived to answer
him in a style that, I had no doubt,
maintained my credit with my aunt.
One reply of mine&mdash;I forget what it was,
and I am very glad I do&mdash;made the old
gentleman burst into a tremendous roar
of laughter, and from that moment he
took a great deal of notice of me, encouraged
my small attempts to exhibit
my parts and wit, and took wine with
me, nodding his head with a cordial
smile, and crying out, before he put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
glass to his lips, how he wished the major
made one of us.</p>

<p>After my aunt and Conny had left the
room, we three gentlemen grew really
affectionate. The two brothers shook
hands several times with each other, and
several times with me, from no other
reason whatever, than an overflowing impulse.
Old days were recalled and old
scenes re-enacted. While my uncle Dick
fished one beaming recollection after another
out of the grey tide of the past,
my uncle Tom was watching him eagerly
to observe when he stopped, in order to
top the reminiscence with another. Some
characteristic anecdotes of my father were
repeated and roared over. Then my
uncle Dick, having laughed himself grave,
grew sentimental, spoke with hazy eyes
of his dead wife, of his pet Teazer, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was dear to him as his right hand, as the
apple of his eye; of departed friends,
whose wit had often cheered, whose
kindness had often soothed him. Never
an ill word for dead or living fell from
him.</p>

<p>A bright scene! a happy evening! a
pleasant and gracious memory&mdash;when the
world was younger with him who writes
this&mdash;of cordiality and good will, of
brotherly love as fresh and childlike still
as ever it was in the old nursery days!
Shall we believe, Eugenio, all that the
cynics tell us? Do relations so universally
hate one another as these gentlemen
make out they do? You have told me
of aunts who have been as faithful in the
love of their dead sisters&#8217; offspring as
ever their mothers were; I have told you
of brothers whose self sacrifices for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
another would fill a volume with tales of
deeper interest than could even be found
in narratives of the most awful murders,
or in minute accounts of the most unblushing
bigamies. Should a cynic expectorate
after tasting a glass of Madeira,
would you accept his spittle as a sample
of the wine he has drunk? Neither
should you regard the instances he relates
to you of family feuds as typical of the
actual feelings that bind relations one to
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, my boy,&#8221; said uncle Dick
to me, &#8220;when are you coming to Thistlewood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name a day convenient to yourself,&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;and then uncle Tom
will perhaps give us his sense of the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the bank,&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
uncle Tom, &#8220;go whenever you like, and
stop as long as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall return from London on Thursday,&#8221;
said uncle Dick, &#8220;and, if you&#8217;ll
come to me on that day, say so, and I&#8217;ll
send a telegram to Teazer to-morrow, to
have a bed-room prepared for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me say Monday,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;That will give your daughter more
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Tom will give you full
directions as to the how and the where?&#8221;
And this being settled, we got talking
of other things.</p>

<p>I grew tired at last of sitting, and wanting
to join Conny, hinted that my aunt
might think us rather selfish, if we lingered
much longer over our cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said uncle Tom, &#8220;so
you go and join the ladies, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
my wife, Dick and I will follow presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conny was reading a novel. My aunt
knitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the name of your book?&#8221; I
asked, going up to my cousin, and sitting
down near her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Love and Sorrow,&#8217;&#8221; answered she.
&#8220;They sent it this afternoon from the
library. It is very interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took up volume the second, and opening
it, caught sight of a passage which
I read aloud: &#8220;Their eyes met. In her&#8217;s
was pride struggling with womanly desire.
In his were blazing those wild passions
which were the fruit of long years
of agony and disappointment. &#8216;By
heavens!&#8217; he cried hoarsely, while the
veins stood out upon his forehead, black
and knotted, &#8216;I would rather take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
you by the throat and cast you dead at
my feet, than see you Lord Algernon&#8217;s
wife. Never,&#8217; he hissed, &#8216;shall that
virgin brow be defaced by a coronet;
never shall that pure form be polluted by&mdash;by&mdash;,&#8217;
he paused, staggered, looked
wildly round him, brushed off the salt
dews that passion had distilled upon his
broad and beautiful forehead with the
back of his hand, and, uttering a low
moan, fell prone upon the carpet. &#8216;I
have killed him!&#8217; poor Madeline shrieked,
rushing to his side and raising his head
and gazing with wild and piteous eyes
upon the white lips and the convulsed
cheeks. At that moment the door opened,
and Lord Algernon entered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a queer story!&#8221; exclaimed my
aunt, who was nevertheless growing interested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8220;It is beautifully written in parts,&#8221;
said Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these your pencil-marks?&#8221; I
asked, taking the volume from her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is &#8216;beautiful!!!&#8217; with three
points of exclamation. &#8216;The silent stream
that runs smoothly past us, checked in
its course becomes a raging torrent.&#8217;
Very true. Here is a passage doubly
underscored: &#8216;It is easy to love a woman,
but difficult to find a woman worth
loving.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind those marks,&#8221; exclaimed
Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the hero often afflicted with salt
dews?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are laughing at me.&#8221; She
snatched the book from my hand, and
pouted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t often read novels,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;but when I do, I must say I like a
good gory story&mdash;something dripping or
dank&mdash;with a yellow-haired heroine who
loves to sit on her lover&#8217;s grave and
braid her tresses by the light of the
moon, and an Italian rival who stabs
everybody in the forehead. If my hair
doesn&#8217;t rise twice at least in every ten
pages, I consider the author a muff.
Domestic stories I hate. There is no
need to subscribe to a library to hear
people ask each other if they prefer
brown bread to white, and muffins to
crumpets, and to watch a curate take a
flute in pieces out of his pocket and
blow &#8216;Ye banks and braes&#8217; to the pensive,
flat-chested lady who works him
slippers, and puts four lumps of sugar
into his tea. Give me, I say, wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and starting eye-balls, matted hair and
clandestine meetings, streams of blood and
gurgling yells. I don&#8217;t object to noblemen,
but I think that money-lenders
make the best villains. I also require
that the heroine be supple and lightsome,
and lissom and loose, with a
tread like a panther, and a spring like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A flea,&#8221; suggested my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a time you men always are
over your wine,&#8221; said Conny. &#8220;What
<i>do</i> you talk about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have received an invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! to Thistlewood?&#8221; asked my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, where I shall no doubt be
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through the heart,&#8221; warbled Conny,
with a sly laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;Teazer, I am told, pulls a deadly
trigger,&#8221; said I, looking at Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you go?&#8221; inquired my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem in a great hurry to have
you,&#8221; with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The invitation was hearty and irresistible.
Yet I am so perfectly happy
at Grove End, that I have no wish to
leave it even for a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must make haste to come back,&#8221;
said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Teazer will let you,&#8221; laughed
Conny.</p>

<p>I whispered, &#8220;Would you care if
Teazer didn&#8217;t let me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung her head and smiled. Her
mamma was looking at us; having, I
believe, overheard my question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;Do you mean yes or no, Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>She honoured me with a look; a full,
deep, inscrutable look. The blue of her
eyes was as fathomless as the blue of
the heavens&mdash;and as expressionless. However,
my heart found the meaning it
wanted in them; and if my aunt hadn&#8217;t
been watching, I should have grown
demonstrative.</p>

<p>My uncles were a long time absent.
&#8220;What <i>can</i> they be doing?&#8221; my aunt
kept on exclaiming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking over business matters, no
doubt,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>Conny went to the piano and began to
play; and when she was in the middle
of one of those fantasias, which you can
only submit to listen to when they are
played by the girl you love, the two old
gentlemen entered. My aunt challenged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
them pretty briskly, and sarcastically
expressed her surprise to see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I quite expected
every moment to hear you ring for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; cried my uncle Dick, who
was in boisterous good spirits. &#8220;We have
been settling the affairs of nations, and
arranging the succession of dynasties.&#8221;</p>

<p>And going up to Conny, he asked her
if she knew &#8220;Tom Bowling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll sing it for you,&#8221; and down
he sat, and sang the song excellently.
It was curious that this big stout man,
whose voice when he talked was a bass,
rose into a thin clear tenor the moment
he began to sing. &#8220;Those are the songs
I like,&#8221; said he, nodding his thanks for
our applause. &#8220;Give me &#8216;The Ivy Green,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and &#8216;Pray Goody,&#8217; and &#8216;I&#8217;m afloat,&#8217; before
all your later trumpery of words and
music, fit only for cats to wail their
loves with. If the songs of a country
are, as they ought to be, the expression
of the national character, what will our
grand-children think of the age that
could produce and enjoy the namby-pamby
you now-a-days hear in concerts
and drawing-rooms? Go back to my
young days, and look into the songs we
used to sing. There is a manliness even
in the most sentimental of Moore&#8217;s ballads&mdash;a
delicate reference to heroic actions
and Irish spirit, which gives them a
flavour you&#8217;ll look for in vain in your
modern verselets. We sang Burns then,
and Campbell, and Byron, and Scott, and
that was the age of Waterloo and Navarino.
You should have heard Incledon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sing &#8216;Tom Moody,&#8217; or Bannister sing
&#8216;Lovely Nan.&#8217; You&#8217;d have been content
to put wadding in your ears for the
remainder of your lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so saying, he wheeled round upon
the music-stool, and played a queer piece
of dance music, which, he said, was called
&#8220;Go to the Devil and shake yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>We passed the rest of the evening
pleasantly, in hearing Conny sing, or
listening to uncle Dick&#8217;s stories, or arguing
good-humouredly on a variety of
topics until ten o&#8217;clock struck, when uncle
Dick said he must go to bed; he had
to be up early to catch the train for
London, and wanted to fortify himself for
a hot and fatiguing day. He shook my
hand very warmly after bidding the others
good-night, and said, &#8220;I shall expect you
on Monday. I daresay Teazer will meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you, if you let her know what train you
arrive by. If not, our house isn&#8217;t a mile
from the station, and you won&#8217;t be able
to miss it after getting into the high
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>I now thought it about time that I
should be making my way home: but
uncle Tom, seeing me prepare to leave,
came up to me, and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s your
hurry? I have something to say to you.
The night is fine, and the longer you
stay, the more brightly the moon will
light you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then turned to his wife, who was
watching us, and said, &#8220;My dear, I have
something of importance to talk over
with Charlie, and we mean to shut
ourselves up in the library. You
need not sit up. Send us in the
whiskey, and we&#8217;ll strive our utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to console ourselves for your absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a quantity of talking you will
have had before you go to bed!&#8221; exclaimed
his wife. &#8220;Pray what is all this
mighty mystery about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of these days you shall hear,&#8221;
replied her husband, with a good-natured
laugh. &#8220;Now then, Charlie, bid your
aunt and Conny good-night, and follow
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>On entering the library, whither he
had preceded me by some minutes, as I
had chosen to linger a little whilst I
wished Conny good-night, I found the
lamp lighted, glasses upon the table, and
my uncle seated in an arm-chair near the
open window. High overhead rode the
brilliant moon; the soft night-wind rustled
the leaves of the trees; and the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
grounds lay mottled with moonshine, and
the shadows of bush and plant. I drew
a chair to the window, lighted a cigar,
and, as I felt the cool air breathing upon
my face, exclaimed, &#8220;A Turk would call
this paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so might a Christian,&#8221; answered
my uncle. &#8220;We ought to be happy.
We ought to be grateful. I hope, I
believe, I am. Few men have better
reason to be satisfied with life than
myself. I enjoy good health; my wife
is the best of women; my girl is dutiful
and loving; my brothers are spared to
delight me with their society whenever
they choose to see me, and,&#8221; he added,
leaning forward and grasping my hand,
&#8220;I have a nephew who is a thoroughly
good fellow, and to whom I am as much
attached as if he were my son.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>I thanked him in warm and affectionate
terms.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>now</i> what do you think of
Dick?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think him a very fine fellow, and
a very fine gentleman, which I did <i>not</i>
think him this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, truly, he&#8217;s a gentleman in a
much higher sense than mere behaviour
and the power of talking well imply. He
is charitable to a fault; so soft-hearted
that he refused to be a magistrate
because he said the position would cost
him more than he was worth, as he never
could agree to a conviction without endowing
the families of the men he helped
to send to gaol. He and I have been
having a long talk about you, and I am
delighted to say that he thinks well of
my scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that I didn&#8217;t offend
him by my somewhat cool reception of
him at the bank this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. He likes you, and believes
he will like you better when he knows
you better, which is the best assurance of
future friendship a man can hold out....
I suppose you know that he is worth
about forty thousand pounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my father mentioned something
of the kind to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a great deal of money for a
man to possess whose tastes are inexpensive,
and who has only one child.
His daughter&#8217;s name, as you know, is
Theresa. She spent a few days with me
some months ago, and I&#8217;ll bet you a hat
that when you see her you&#8217;ll think her
as handsome a girl as is anywhere to be
met.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s her age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair or dark?&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither. But don&#8217;t ask me to catalogue
her charms, you shall judge for
yourself. Now, my boy, I&#8217;ll tell you
what I want you to do. Dick is anxious
to see Teazer married. He feels himself
growing old, and has been rendered uneasy
lately by some kind friend telling
him that he looks an apoplectic subject.
He told me tonight, that on the day of
his daughter&#8217;s marriage he will give her
ten thousand pounds. My scheme&mdash;the
scheme he thoroughly relishes&mdash;is for you
to marry her, bring the money into the
bank, and I&#8217;ll make you a partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pulled my cigar out of my mouth,
and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry her!&#8221; I gasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied my uncle. &#8220;Of
course you will have to get her to love
you; but that,&#8221; he added with a laugh,
&#8220;is what you call in France a <i>fait
entendu</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;I&#8217;m not sure&mdash;I think&mdash;in
fact I would rather not marry her,&#8221;
I stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, don&#8217;t say that until you&#8217;ve seen
her,&#8221; said my uncle, with a deprecating
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, pray consider your
position. Outside of my bank you have
no prospects. You <i>must</i> admit that. I
never meant you to be a clerk. The
moment I received your father&#8217;s letter,
the idea of a marriage between you and
Theresa occurred to me, and I was delighted
with a notion that could not fail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to make both my brothers happy. Of
course I could not unfold my scheme
until I had consulted with Dick, and
watched your progress. But Dick, I tell
you, likes the proposal immensely, and
you are now sufficiently acquainted with
business to qualify you for a partnership.
You have still much to learn, indeed;
but you can pick the whole thing up by
degrees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear uncle,&#8221; I cried, interrupting
him, &#8220;I appreciate your generosity, I am
overcome, at least with one view of your
liberal intentions&mdash;but it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late! what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am already in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come! you are joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am already deeply in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deeply in love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;with your daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; he exclaimed, giving a little
jump in his chair, &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean&mdash;what?&mdash;in
love with Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he cried, with great impetuosity;
&#8220;that&#8217;s impossible&mdash;that&#8217;s out
of the question. You can&#8217;t marry her.
You&#8217;re not suited for each other. Consider,
my <i>dear</i> boy, how could you support
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have considered nothing. All that
I know is, I love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what does <i>she</i> say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She asks for time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he cried, lost in amazement,
&#8220;have you proposed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I gasped, &#8220;and she asked me
to give her time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does my wife know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe she does.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;And she has never dropped me a hint.
Upon my word, this is not the first time
things have happened in my house, right
under my nose, which all the world has
seen but me. But it&#8217;s out of the question.
My plans are formed, and they don&#8217;t include
your marriage with Conny. No.
<i>Your</i> wife must be Theresa. You are
made for each other. When I die, who
do I leave behind me to keep the bank
going? This has been on my mind for
years. But when I got your father&#8217;s letter
I instantly saw my way. <i>You</i> should
marry Theresa, who would bring you a
fortune to put into the concern, and
Conny should wait until some eligible
young man offered for her hand, and then
I&#8217;d make <i>him</i> a partner. You two would
carry on the business after my death.
Conny is sure to marry sooner or later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
she is too pretty to remain single. As
to the objections you could make against
marrying a woman for her money, I can
anticipate them all by simply showing you
that your partnership will be a handsome
equivalent for the fortune she
brings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late! too late!&#8221; I muttered, looking
at the moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the deuce didn&#8217;t my wife speak
to me about this nonsense?&#8221; asked my
uncle, who was evidently fretting over her
secret share in the matter. &#8220;But all
women are alike. No matter which way
the current runs, you&#8217;ll find them rowing
against it. Why, surely she can&#8217;t see
her way in your marriage with Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t poo-pooh me,&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how I love
her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know. I would
much rather not hear. The thing&#8217;s a
mistake. I never expected it. It must
end. You&#8217;re a fine fellow, and I would
as soon see you Conny&#8217;s husband as
another man. But there are obstacles not
to be got over under a larger sum of
money than you possess. Don&#8217;t disappoint
me. Don&#8217;t object and argue. My
scheme is perfect. I maintain it is a
magnificent scheme. It assures your fortune;
it assures the permanency of the
bank; it increases our capital; it gratifies
my brother, and will please your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>I puffed furiously at my cigar, too
much overcome to speak. I suppose he
must have seen how completely upset I
was, for dropping his somewhat energetic
and expostulatory tone, he said in his
kindest manner,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Charlie, we won&#8217;t discuss the
subject any further tonight. It is only
reasonable, after all, that it should take
you by surprise. I have a sound confidence
in your good sense, and have no
doubt whatever, that after you have
turned the matter over once or twice
in your mind, you will agree with me
in thinking my plan a remarkably fine
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; I muttered to myself.
&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or what is better,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;instead of disturbing yourself with
reflections, wait until you have met
Theresa. If she doesn&#8217;t bring you to her
feet, may this glass be my poison!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t consider my feelings,&#8221; I
said, bitterly. &#8220;You forget that I am
already in love.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;Well, well, wait till you have met
Theresa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; said I, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think my scheme a splendid one,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like selling your soul to the
devil, to marry a woman only for her
money!&#8221; I burst out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll marry her for love&mdash;mark my
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love! how many hearts do you think
I have? but no matter&mdash;I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here I got up, for I was really afraid
of growing hysterical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father will jump for joy when
he hears of this,&#8221; said my uncle, squeezing
my hand.</p>

<p>Now, whether I <i>was</i> hysterical, or
whether my sense of the ridiculous was
deeply stirred by the ludicrous image of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
my tall and stately father jumping for
joy, I burst into a loud laugh, in which
my uncle joined; and half choking with
a fit of merriment that was really made
ghastly by its approximation to the most
morbid and passionate thoughts, I rushed
away from the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching my lodgings I went to bed;
but I might as well have sat up, for the
dawn brightened into clear daylight before
I closed my eyes. I lay thinking over
my uncle&#8217;s scheme and abusing it, and
wishing he had been born an idiot rather
than that his mind should have stumbled
upon an idea so peculiarly disagreeable.</p>

<p>What chiefly worried me was not his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
wish that I should marry Theresa&mdash;for
really that was a matter altogether in
my power, and a circumstance over
which nobody but myself could have any
control&mdash;but the very decided manner in
which he had expressed himself against
my love for Conny. I had not expected
it. I felt insulted. I considered that my
pride had received a wound. I had made
sure that he would have welcomed my
love for his daughter with irrepressible
delight. He was so amiable a man, with
so mild a manner, that the warm way in
which he had attempted to annihilate my
hopes impressed and affected me as if he
had flown in a passion.</p>

<p>But I needn&#8217;t inflict all my thoughts
upon you. It is enough to say that
before falling asleep I had made up my
mind to allow no earthly power to sunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
me from my adored, and marry me to a
woman I already disliked before having
seen.</p>

<p>My uncle was very friendly next day,
but did not allude to the subject of our
evening&#8217;s conversation. He asked me to
dine with him, and I consented; for I
wanted to talk to my aunt, and get her
advice and sympathy. I felt very much
disposed to be cool and haughty with my
uncle, to let all the fine gentleman that
was pent up in my bosom fly out, and
resent his ruthless intrusion on what a
young lady once called in my hearing,
&#8220;The innermost recesses of the most
secret shrine within the holy of holies of
the heart&#8217;s core.&#8221; But his amiability disarmed
me. The antiseptic dews of his
generous nature fell upon my temper, and
kept it sweet in spite of my earnest belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that the sleeping lion inside me ought to
get up, stiffen his tail, and shake the
forests.</p>

<p>My aunt and Conny were out when I
got to Grove End, and did not return
until twenty minutes before dinner-time,
so that I could have no conversation
until we had dined. At table, I was
very calm and pensive, and felt so sentimental,
that I think, had I been asked,
I could have written an ode fit to appear
in any private album. I watched Conny
incessantly: too much so, I fear, for I
believe I embarrassed her. I wish she had
laughed: I wish she had sneered: I wish
she had insulted me. I wanted steeling.
But no! she gave me thrilling looks, kept
her countenance, and eat so languidly, that
my heart leapt up, like Wordsworth&#8217;s when
he saw the blue sky; I believed that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
father&#8217;s scheme had been unfolded to her,
and that the fear of losing me had taught
her to know she <span class="smcap">LOVED</span>!</p>

<p>Neither my uncle nor aunt conversed
with their wonted ease. A cloud overhung
us. I noticed that, when Thomas
spoke, his wife grew absent; that when
he addressed her, she grew disdainful.
Yes! there had been a quarrel; no, not
a quarrel, but an argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a woman,&#8221; I thought, regarding
her affectionately; &#8220;and all women are on
the side of sentiment <i>versus</i> lucre; passion
<i>versus</i> fine houses: emotion <i>versus</i> Gillow&#8217;s
furniture. She will be my friend: fight
for me against her husband, and Dick,
and Teazer: save me from being married
in spite of my screams, and finally hand
me victorious to her lovely, blushing
Conny.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>After dinner my uncle asked me to
smoke a cigar with him in the library.
I thanked him, and declined. I wanted
to get to my aunt, and felt as if the
smell of a cigar would make me ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;
he exclaimed, looking at me earnestly.
&#8220;Not smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I don&#8217;t care about smoking,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. I have often
thought that you smoke too much.
Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the grounds. I find this room
uncommonly warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, I mentioned our conversation
to my wife, and I am mortified
to find her opposed to the scheme. The
fact is, women never will take practical
views. They don&#8217;t seem able to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that money is necessary for life;
and many of them, I am persuaded,
believe that their husbands have nothing
to do, when a bill comes in, but to go
out of doors and pick enough money
out of the soil to pay it with. I can
quite understand her liking you so well
as to regret that it is out of our power
to sanction your marriage with Conny;
but I <i>can&#8217;t</i> understand her thinking such
a match desirable, when she knows that&mdash;through
no fault of yours&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t
support a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather talk in the open air,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;This room is very oppressive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I&#8217;ll follow you presently.
I am very glad to see that you are
beginning to take to my scheme
kindly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;I!&#8221; but I wouldn&#8217;t argue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The simple fact is,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;that my wife, like all mothers, is jealous
of anybody receiving the attention which
she thinks her daughter has a right to
before all other young ladies. If it came
to the point, you would find her as
averse to your marriage with Conny as
I am; but as it hasn&#8217;t come to the point,
she frets&mdash;the silly woman!&mdash;over the
idea of Theresa getting the admiration
which she claims for her girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I. &#8220;However,
you&#8217;ll join me presently.&#8221; And I went
out.</p>

<p>Conny was on the lawn, but my aunt
was in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, aunt,&#8221; I exclaimed, bluntly,
taking a seat beside her, &#8220;what do you
think of your husband&#8217;s scheme?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;It is all fudge and nonsense,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;He was angry with me last
night after you left, for having concealed
my suspicions from him that you were
fond of Conny. But, as I told him, I
choose to have my secrets as well as
he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to marry Theresa,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;I am not going down to a
man&#8217;s house to make love to his daughter,
and ask her to be my wife, as if I were
a curiosity-dealer taking a journey in order
to drive a bargain for a piece of china.
My uncle knows that I am in love with
Conny, and, although he pooh-poohs me,
never will he get me to alter my sentiments,
and forsake her for a woman who
shoots pistols!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas knows <i>my</i> sentiments about
his scheme,&#8221; said my aunt, with a toss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of her head. &#8220;I am only surprised that
two brothers should put their noses
together and discuss marriage as if it
were a matter of buying and selling.
Were Richard to ask my opinion&mdash;though
he never would, for he has a most degraded
notion of women&#8217;s minds&mdash;I shouldn&#8217;t
scruple to tell him that he was acting in
a most unfatherly manner in making his
fortune the chief attraction of his daughter,
instead of insisting that she should be
loved only for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sentiments to a t!&#8221; I cried, grasping
her hand, &#8220;and I honour you for
having the courage to express them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is too true,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;that men who have been mixed up all
their lives in business matters become at
last unable to take any but a mercenary
view of life.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, and the worst is, that commercial
views of things are always so
disagreeable to one&#8217;s wishes. Mustn&#8217;t this
be an abominable world where you are
not allowed to put one leg before the
other, unless you can pull out your
purse, and show you have enough in it
to pay for the privilege of walking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk of man!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Why, man
is the most miserable of all created
things. Birds, and fish, and animals,
come into the world already clothed; all
degrees of temperature are pretty much
alike to them; they are prepared for
changes. Their breakfasts, dinners, and
suppers lie scattered for them upon the
face of the world, and all they have to
do is to eat and drink. They may pair
without anybody&#8217;s consent; they&#8217;ve got no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
relations to interfere, and no marriage
settlements to make them hate each other.
But man is born naked, with a skin so
sensitive that heat and cold give him
equal tortures. He has got to dig for
his food, without being sure of finding
any. He is kicked if he hasn&#8217;t money,
and is plundered if he has. If he falls
in love with a woman, it is a hundred
to one that he marries somebody else, for
thousands of obstacles are piled up in
his way. Worse than all, he&#8217;s cursed
with thought and memory; so that, however
happy he tries to be in the present,
there&#8217;s always misery enough in the past
to poison his existing bliss, and uncertainty
enough in the future to make him
dread to look forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying which I ground my teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all too true,&#8221; replied my aunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
dolefully; &#8220;and there can be no doubt
that man is a wretch in more senses than
one. But I wouldn&#8217;t be cast down if I
were you. You have a friend in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks&mdash;thanks; I know I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it really needn&#8217;t follow that,
because you <i>visit</i> your other cousin at
Thistlewood, you need <i>marry</i> her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. No human power&mdash;but
I won&#8217;t boast. Time shall prove.
Your husband&#8217;s scheme wouldn&#8217;t give me
a moment&#8217;s uneasiness, if it were not for
the decided objection he expressed to my
loving Conny. For who could force me
to marry Theresa if I declined?&#8221; And I
folded my arms and fixed a steady gaze
on my aunt&#8217;s cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as to my husband, leave him to
me,&#8221; said my aunt, with a profound nod.
&#8220;It is true that he can sometimes have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his secrets; but,&#8221; she added, proudly, &#8220;I
can always have my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He objects because I am poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he told me his reasons this
morning, and I gave him mine for wishing
to see you my daughter&#8217;s husband.
I warned him against Mr. Curling. I
said, &#8216;I have eyes in my head, and can
see that Charlie will make her happy.
But if you drive your nephew into loving
another woman, as sure as you are a
man, Conny will grow sentimental again
over your cashier. How are you to help
it?&#8217; I asked him. &#8216;You bring no young
men to the house: she sees no society;
if she isn&#8217;t actually in love with Charlie,
she told me enough to persuade me that
it will not be long before she loves him.&#8217;
But he pish&#8217;d and pshaw&#8217;d, and pooh-pooh&#8217;d
me down, and told me I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
interfering, and that I was foolish to
imagine for a moment that there had
been anything serious between Conny and
Mr. Curling. You&#8217;d be surprised to know
how very stubborn Thomas can be when
he likes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;is there to prevent
him from making me a partner? He
means that I should join him if I marry
Theresa; what&#8217;s to prevent me joining
him should I marry Conny? Perhaps if
you were to suggest this to him, it might
give him an idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not touch upon the bank nor
discuss the matter in a mercenary way
at all. Thomas knows very well what
he can afford; and I should certainly
think it very hard if, after working all
these years, and obliging me to be polite
to objectionable people merely for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
custom, he hasn&#8217;t money enough to enable
his daughter to marry the man of <i>my</i>
choice. I am quite content to threaten
him with Mr. Curling. He has a very
good opinion of my judgment, and I
often hear him repeating my remarks
for his own, forgetting where he got
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here unfortunately we were interrupted
by his entering the room, followed by
Conny. Had it not been for her daughter&#8217;s
presence, I believe that my aunt would
have attacked her husband pretty freely,
for she had worked herself up into a
great state of excitement, and stood in
no need of further provocation to speak
her mind. He perfectly well knew what
we had been talking about, and deprecated
his wife&#8217;s stern gaze with a bland
smile; then expressed his surprise to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
me indoors after my recent complaint of
the heat.</p>

<p>I liked him so well, was under so
many obligations to him, and was so
sensible that, though his scheme was
entirely obnoxious to me, he had nevertheless
contrived it in the generous hope
of forwarding my interests, that it was
quite impossible for me to be reserved or
cool to him. I told him that I should
be glad to smoke a cigar out of doors, a
proposal he eagerly welcomed, being, as
I could see, extremely anxious to avoid
any discussion with his wife in my presence.
I thought, when we were alone,
that he would ask me what my aunt
and I had been talking about, and made
up my mind to answer him freely.
Instead, he resolutely avoided the subject.
Conny joined us: and, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
quarter of an hour&#8217;s conversation, he
returned to the house, leaving me alone
with my cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder your papa allows us to be
alone,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He ought to keep
between us, since he so strongly objects
to my loving you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadfully plain-spoken you are,
Charlie. You oughtn&#8217;t to talk to me in
this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> know I love you,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;and your father knows it, and everybody
knows it. What&#8217;s the use of concealment,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said she, with delicious
coyness, &#8220;papa thinks there would be
no use in his interfering between us for
once only, since you are here every
day, and can be with me when he is
away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; I asked, looking at
her askew, &#8220;that your papa and I had
a&mdash;a conversation last night after we left
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma said something about it this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him that after I had won
your love, I should want to marry you:
and he said, it was out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you talk about loving and
marrying me?&#8221; she asked, a little peevishly;
and then instantly changing her
tone, and letting me look down deep into
her eyes, she said, &#8220;How do you know I
will ever marry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll <i>make</i> you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so fiercely. You quite
frighten me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Conny, for God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t jest
with my feelings,&#8221; I groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want people to love you at first
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">People!!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised that you wouldn&#8217;t speak
to me about&mdash;about your feelings again
until I gave you leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d have kept my word, if your
father hadn&#8217;t told me he would not sanction
our marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope he wouldn&#8217;t sanction it
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you talk like that? But I
didn&#8217;t ask him to sanction it. In fact,
I don&#8217;t remember speaking about our
marriage. He wanted me to make love
to Theresa, and I told him that was
impossible, because I was in love with
you. And I shall always consider&mdash;fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as I am of him&mdash;that he spoke to me
rather heartlessly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you object to do what he
wants?&#8221; she inquired, with a slight raising
of the eyebrows, which was peculiar to
her, and which made a complete conundrum
of the expression that her face
might happen to wear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you ask? You know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard that she is very
pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one pretty woman in
the world, and her name is Conny.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not help looking pleased;
a bright colour came into her face, and
she was silent. When I peeped at her
again, the colour had faded, and she was
as pensive and down-looking as any
nun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conny,&#8221; I whispered, in my softest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
voice, &#8220;if you will only tell me you love
me, and will consent to marry me, your
father must give way. The decision that
is to make me supremely happy or
supremely miserable rests with you, not
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; she answered, in a voice a
very great deal softer than mine, &#8220;you
must give me time. Some of these days
I may be able to answer you decisively;
but you must never talk of <i>making</i> me
love you, for if I don&#8217;t turn to you naturally,
I shall never turn to you at all.
Besides, you ought to see Theresa. You
might like her better than me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might find her a far more
suitable wife than ever I could make you,
and might think her infinitely prettier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>might</i> become a king. I <i>might</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
take the moon out of the sky, and put
it in my pocket. And I mightn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events I am determined not
to hear another word from you until you
have seen her. You must be tried a
little before I make up my mind. The
old saying is, &#8216;no man can be considered
honest until he has been tempted.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is your opinion of me,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;it is quite right that I should go
to Thistlewood. I want to be tested. I
only hope that I may find Theresa perfectly
beautiful, and thoroughly womanly,
and brilliantly clever, and superfine in
every point, to prove that, compared to
you, she will be no more to me than
that bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; and now, not another
word until you come back. Give me
your word.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I groaned. &#8220;But I wish
you&#8217;d let me take away some little remembrance,
some dear promise, some
sweet word of hope, to comfort me in
my absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, blushed, turned pale,
looked at me, shook her head, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;it is too late; you have pledged
your word, and you mustn&#8217;t ask me for
a sign of any kind until you return from
Thistlewood.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the evasive little creature, with
her hair shining like spangles in the rays
of the setting sun, danced a minuet
across the lawn, and vanished within the
house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Isaac.</i> &#8220;Good lack, with what eyes a father sees!
As I have life she is the very reverse of all this.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Duenna.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Monday</span> morning came; a still and hazy
morning, portentous of noontide heat. I
had not written to uncle Richard to tell
him the train I meant to leave by, for two
reasons: I didn&#8217;t want to give him or his
daughter the trouble of meeting me, and
as there were several trains during the day,
I could not say at what hour I might take
it into my head to start.</p>

<p>However, as it was not possible for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to see Conny, and as the time promised
to hang tediously upon my hands, I sent
the landlady for a fly, packed a carpetbag,
and started to catch a train that left
at half-past twelve.</p>

<p>On my way to the station, I stopped
at the bank to bid my uncle a final
farewell, but found him out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy yourself,&#8221; said
Mr. Curling, with a grave face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be long absent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps a week; perhaps
a fortnight. Good-bye.&#8221; And out
I went.</p>

<p>Great heaven! as I recall the nod I
gave him, I am amazed to think how
full of the unexpected the future is.
You shake a man by the hand and
leave him, and by the time you meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
him again, everything the least likely to
occur has happened. Though you held
him the most honest of living beings, he
is committed for forgery; or though you
thought him doomed to be a struggling
man all his life, he has made a fortune
on the Stock Exchange, and is surrounded
by architects with plans for a
mansion; or though you considered him
a very ordinary-minded person, he has
just acknowledged himself the author of
a book the world has gone into ecstacies
over. So shifting is this life, it is scarcely
possible to turn your back upon the most
familiar object, without finding it changed
on looking at it again. It is a pantomime,
but not a droll one. Harlequin
Time does indeed frisk it merrily; but
there is too much of the scythe about
his rod, too much tragedy about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
metamorphoses he works, to make us
think him diverting.</p>

<p>It was a little after half-past twelve
when I got into the train, and it was
very nearly half-past two when I got
out. Thistlewood Station was a little
platform, backed by a diminutive shed,
with a great hill running up behind it.
I asked a porter the way to Mr. Hargrave&#8217;s
house, and he directed me to a
high road.</p>

<p>This high road was terribly dusty and
dazzling to the eyes. There was not an
inch of shade to right or left of it to
protect me from the overpowering rays
of the sun. Worst of all, for half a
mile at least, it was a steep hill. I felt
my face gradually turning to the colour
of a boiled lobster as I toiled along, and
deplored my want of foresight in not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
providing against this sweltering exertion,
by asking my uncle to send his carriage
to meet me.</p>

<p>On either side was a boundless extent
of corn-fields, with never a sigh of air to
disturb their yellowing heads. On reaching
the summit of the hill, however, I
was cheered by a very extensive view,
not indeed comparable in beauty to that
which was to be obtained from any of
the hills about Updown, but exceedingly
pretty, nevertheless. Far away down on
the level plains were little white villages,
shining amid groups of trees. A long
line of railroad ruled the landscape, along
which rolled a white cloud, that no
doubt represented the train I had just
quitted. The slate-coloured hills of the
far-off horizon stood sharp and well-defined
against the pale blue sky.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>I trudged forward, gasping for air, and
stopping frequently to press a handkerchief
to my forehead, until I espied, at
the extreme end of the road, a long wall
bounding a perfect forest of trees. In a
few minutes I had gained a gate surmounted
by stone effigies. Close at hand
was a lodge. I pulled the bell, and on
a man presenting himself, inquired if this
were Mr. Hargrave&#8217;s house? It was.
The gate was opened, and I passed out of
the broiling road into a deliciously cool
avenue, with deep glades and sunny
openings among the trees, under which
I observed some young deer browsing.
The whole place was alive with the
pipings of birds. Such a babel of airy
voices I never before heard.</p>

<p>I was stepping pretty briskly along
the avenue, wondering what sort of reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I should get, and whether my uncle
was as cheery and hearty a man in his
own house as he was out of it, when I
suddenly heard the word &#8220;Halt!&#8221; uttered
in a loud, clear, imperious female voice.</p>

<p>I looked about me, being uncertain
from which side of the avenue the voice
had proceeded, and seeing nobody, was
in the act of advancing again, when
bang! went the report of a pistol, so
close and so loud, that, for the moment,
I actually believed myself shot, and pulled
off my hat, feeling pretty sure that I
should find a bullet hole in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; I thought. &#8220;What is
the meaning of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>A thin cloud of blue smoke curled up
from a tree on the right, and, as I
gazed with a stupefied air in that direction,
the tall commanding figure of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
woman stepped forward, and approached
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you halt when I ordered
you?&#8221; she demanded, fixing a pair of
dark, glittering eyes on me.</p>

<p>I looked at her with amazement. She
was dressed in a tight-fitting body, with
a long skirt, which she held up in one
hand, whilst she grasped a small revolver
in the other. On her head was a large
garden hat which threw so dark a shadow
over her face that I could master no
more of its details than the keen bright
eyes. Could this be my cousin Theresa?</p>

<p>I was so much astonished by the report
of the pistol, and her peremptory address,
that I quite forgot my manners. I had
hastily put my hat on, and there I kept
it. &#8220;You may bless your stars,&#8221; she
exclaimed, &#8220;that I didn&#8217;t take the curl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
out of your mustache with a pistol ball.
I could do it. Do you doubt me? Turn
your face round, so that I get your
profile.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she levelled her pistol full at my
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; I stammered; &#8220;and
what do you mean to do? Put that
pistol down. Don&#8217;t you know that you
can&#8217;t play with a more dangerous toy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn your face round as I order you,
sir,&#8221; was her answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no such thing,&#8221; I said,
picking up my carpet bag, which I had
dropped, but furtively watching her movements
with indescribable anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, to my inexpressible
relief, turning the muzzle of the
pistol aside, &#8220;if you are <i>afraid</i>, that is
another matter. However, for the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
when I order you to stop, I should advise
you to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so saying, she wheeled round, and
disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p>I hastened forward, not doubting for a
moment that, whether she was my cousin
or not, she was not in possession of her
reason, and congratulating myself on what
I could not but consider a very narrow
escape of my life. In a few moments I
reached the house, a fine old building
with a great door and many windows,
the upper ones hooded, and a broad
carpet of grass all round it, on to
which the queerest little doors opened,
with large bow-windows on the ground-floor.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a corpulent
man in a claret-coloured livery, and a
groggy eye, who, on my asking if Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Hargrave was within, cocked his head,
and reflected a little before he answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;He is, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, show me in, and tell Mr. Hargrave
I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, sir,&#8221; answered the man, whose
accent intimated his nationality pretty
powerfully.</p>

<p>I thought him a bit of a fool, or perhaps
new to his place, and entered the hall,
remarking, however, that he shrank away
from me as I passed him. Burnt up by
the sun, and blinded by the glare in the
road, and wearied by my walk, and half-choked
with dust, and, above all, utterly
disgusted with the extraordinary behaviour
of the young lady of the avenue, I flung
my hat and bag pettishly on the hall
table and marched into a long, handsome
drawing-room, the fat man-servant meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
watching me intently as I entered,
and hurriedly banging the door to when
I was within.</p>

<p>I threw myself into an arm-chair,
thankful for the privilege of resting myself,
and glanced languidly around the
spacious room. In any other mood I
should have found a great deal to admire;
but I was so vexed and amazed by my
reception in the avenue, and so irritated
by the imbecile behaviour of the footman,
that I could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>However, I had scarcely been seated a
minute when my uncle came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you? how are you?&#8221; he
cried, grasping my hand. &#8220;Delighted to
see you and to welcome you. Why
didn&#8217;t you let us know the train you
came by? We would have saved you a
scorching walk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&#8220;I wish I had,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;that hill
near the station has nearly been the death
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that road in summer is awful.
But a glass of seltzer and brandy will
soon set you right,&#8221; and he rang the
bell. &#8220;How did you leave them at Grove
End?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a happy family, aren&#8217;t they?
It always does me good to spend a day
or two with Tom. He has the very best
nature in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here my fat friend entered. How the
fool stared at me! I thought there must
be something extraordinary in my appearance,
and under that impression, got
up, after he had left the room, and
looked at myself in the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mind being a little sunburnt,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
called out my uncle, who mistook
my object. &#8220;I like men well
tanned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I was looking to
see what there could be in my face to
cause your man to stare at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he? Pray don&#8217;t mind him. He&#8217;s
an Irishman and a faithful fellow, though
not a smart waiter. I keep him for his
wit, which is sometimes first-rate. He
came to me with a high character out
of Lord Lavender&#8217;s family. Every Hibernian
must be forgiven something. You
know what Burke said: &#8216;All Irishmen
carry a bit of potato in their
heads.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the man returned. He fixed
his little black eyes on me as he handed
me the foaming draught, and for the life
of me I couldn&#8217;t help bursting into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
laugh when, on quitting the room, he
stared at me intently, whilst he slowly
closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That has refreshed you, hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. By the way, I must
ask you not to be surprised or shocked
if you catch me drinking more brandy
than may seem good for me whilst I am
with you. I don&#8217;t possess my father&#8217;s
iron nerves, and have a foreboding that
I shall stand in need of strong stimulants
to sustain me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear a shot fired about ten
minutes ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My life has been attempted,&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&#8220;Where? When? By whom?&#8221; cried
my uncle, staring at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your avenue, and by a tall lady
in a tight-fitting dress, whom I have
strong reasons for suspecting to be your
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face relaxed, and he burst out into
one of his stunning roars of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what the minx did?&#8221; he
shouted.</p>

<p>I told him. Again the room resounded
to his roar. As there was really nothing
in the incident to occasion so much
violent hilarity, I assumed that his sense
of the ridiculous was aggravated by the
pertinacious gravity of my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me! excuse me!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;It was wrong&mdash;it was rude&mdash;but oh!
what an idea! what an idea! Did you
think you were shot?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Really, I had no time to think. I
was too much surprised by the lady&#8217;s
very novel reception of her father&#8217;s guest,
to reflect upon my danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, don&#8217;t be annoyed by the child&#8217;s
nonsense,&#8221; he exclaimed, recovering his
composure. &#8220;She is very much to blame
for alarming you, and I shall rate her
soundly for her conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pray say no more about it, uncle.
I confess she surprised me, but I should
be very sorry for her to think that I am
offended. One thing I must hasten to
do when we meet: I must vindicate my
character from the charge of cowardice.
She looked so very fierce, and levelled
her loaded pistol in so very threatening
a manner, that the stoutest hero might
well have been allowed to feel a little
timid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; answered my uncle, looking
now thoroughly annoyed, &#8220;that she would
give up this foolish practice of firing
pistols. I like to think my girl plucky;
but every day I expect to hear of some
accident. Ever since her mother&#8217;s death,
she has had her own way in everything&mdash;though,
for all that, I don&#8217;t think her
nature has been spoilt by my indulgence.&#8221;
He said this with a shake of the head,
that plainly said, &#8220;I am sure it hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a charming house,&#8221; said I,
anxious to change the subject, now that
I saw he was annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not such a snuggery as Tom&#8217;s,&#8221; he
answered, and took me to a window at
the back of the drawing-room, which
commanded a fair view of the grounds,
and told me of some titled poet, I forget
what lord, who had resided here in seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hundred and something four, and of
the several famous people, such as Wilkes and
Foote, and Selwyn, whom his lordship
had entertained. These memories
appeared to constitute its great charm in
his eyes, and it was with no small pride
that he told me there was a room upstairs,
in which Soame Jenyns had written
his &#8220;Art of Dancing.&#8221; (I quote from
memory, and won&#8217;t be sure that I give
the right names.) Had he only guessed
how tired I was, he would have reserved
his gossip.</p>

<p>He presently asked me if I would like
to go to my bed-room, and on my answering
yes, laid hold of my carpet bag&mdash;which
by the way he laughed at, desiring
me to tell him what time I meant to
spend at his house&mdash;and conducted me
to a room furnished so luxuriously, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
commanding so fine a view, that I
couldn&#8217;t have been more impressed, had
I been shown into a state bed-chamber
at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said he, looking round him
with a glowing face, &#8220;in this room, my
boy, I have been told, on the very best
authority, Smollett corrected the last pages
of his &#8216;Adventures of an Atom.&#8217; What
do you say to <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read &#8216;Roderick Random,&#8217;&#8221; I
answered, &#8220;and think it in parts as funny
as &#8216;Pickwick.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he exclaimed, seating himself
near the open window, whilst I,
seeing it was not his intention to leave,
pulled off my coat, and fell to cooling
my face in a basin of water, &#8220;nothing
equal to Pickwick was ever written.
Dickens is a truer humourist than Smollett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and what&#8217;s more,&#8221; he added, warmly,
&#8220;there are portions of his writings of
which the irony is as good as anything
to be found in Swift. Tell me in what
particular Dickens isn&#8217;t a match for any
writer that&#8217;s gone before him? His
knowledge of human nature is as great as
Fielding&#8217;s; his pathos is deeper and truer
than Sterne&#8217;s; he is as tender as Goldsmith,
and far funnier than Smollett, who
is always farcical when he is comical. I
love this great man, and reverence him
for the noble use he has made of his
noble genius. May the day never break,&#8221;
he exclaimed, with a solemnity that
astonished me, &#8220;when Dickens shall cease
to be admired; for then surely will all
the fine qualities that make up the
English character, the love of country,
sympathy with the suffering, affection for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the past, hatred of cant, and devotion to
all that is manly and honest and true,
have perished from among us. Whilst
these qualities last Dickens will last; his
fame rests upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, he pulled out a cigar-case,
asked me if I would smoke, and on my
declining, began to puff away like a
steam-engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may do what we like here,&#8221; said
he, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to beat liberty,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said he, expelling a great
cloud of smoke with a sigh, &#8220;our happiest
days are most often the days of
restraint. When my poor wife was alive
my liberties were jealously curtailed; and
now I would give up every liberty I
possess to clasp her dear hand again, to
look into her dear eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;Does Theresa resemble you or her
mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a mingling of us both in
her. But the mother preponderates. She
has profound passions, the deepest nature
a woman ever had. Such tenderness!
such generous impulses! She has not her
equal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good gracious! I thought. How affection
blinds us! Tender, indeed&mdash;confound
her! she nearly killed me! And
here I thought of Conny, and inwardly
groaned, &#8220;Always thine, my own! faithful
unto the end!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go down-stairs?&#8221; asked my
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; I replied; and we left
the room. But we didn&#8217;t go down-stairs
at once. My uncle was very proud of
his house, and was evidently determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to lose no time in showing me over
it. My amiability was proof against my
weariness; but I really shuddered at the
prospect of being shown into, perhaps,
twenty rooms, and detained on each
threshold in order to hear the literary
and social history that made up the
interest of the floors and walls.</p>

<p>However, our progress was not so
tedious as I had feared. On entering one
room, indeed, my misgivings returned:
for, in this room somebody of importance
had, in a fit of intoxication, played
a practical joke of a very awful nature,
the effect of which was to render a negro
imbecile for life; but, after this narrative,
we got on pretty briskly.</p>

<p>A very few words will describe the
house. It was full of long passages and
rooms, into which I was constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
stumbling, owing to the majority of them
being sunk a foot or so beneath the level
of the corridors. Some of them were
empty: those that were furnished were
furnished handsomely. One side of the
roof was flat, and my uncle led me
through a trap-door, whence we emerged
into so broiling a sun, and on to a floor
so burning, that I darted hastily down
the staircase, protesting that if I wasn&#8217;t
killed by a sunstroke, I should be roasted
alive. He told me that, in the cool of
the evening, it was a great treat to sit
upon this roof, &#8220;for from it,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;you may obtain as fine a prospect as
any to be found in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was beginning to grow somewhat
curious to meet my cousin, and to examine
with calmness and courage a young
lady who thought nothing of enforcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
her commands with a revolver; but my
uncle had not yet done with his house.
I was to see the library before I was to
be allowed to take mine ease. I hardly
cared enough about books in those days
to feel an interest in his collection. He
was a complete Oldbuck in his devotion
to old volumes, broadsides, tracts, and
scarce editions. Many of his books, he
assured me, as he stood with his back to
the door, complacently surveying the large
collection that was ranged, row upon
row, round the walls, were worth their
weight in gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said he, pulling out a folio,
&#8220;is a book for which I gave eight guineas,
and for which I should consider myself
insulted by an offer of twenty. Look at
those engravings. You might search a
thousand libraries, and not find this gem.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The name of the book I forget: but I
wouldn&#8217;t own that the engraving he
opened the book at, and pointed to with
immense triumph, struck me as very
rude, and not to be compared with
illustrations to be found in modern books,
costing only a few shillings. Bibliomania
must be humoured, like any other form
of madness. I was bitten with it myself
not many years ago, and thought more of
old bundles of illegible print stitched in
parchment, well perforated with moths and
worms, than of emeralds and diamonds.
He pulled down several other volumes to
show me, explaining their value and
chattering about their contents in a style
which convinced me that he was one of
the very few book-buyers who are book-readers.
I grew at last so thoroughly
tired of having to stand and feign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
attention and interest, that I proposed
that we should return to the drawing-room,
where I might hope to meet my
cousin.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Although her father is ... excessively rich, I
should, were I a youth of quality, hesitate between
a girl so neglected and a negro.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was nobody in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t Teazer come to us?&#8221;
exclaimed my uncle. &#8220;Stay you here, my
boy, and I&#8217;ll go and call her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took a chair at the table, and began
to inspect the contents of an album filled
with photographs. Here was something
to interest me, for on the very first page
was a portrait of my father, taken ten
years before, by little Chatelain, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Rue d&#8217;Epingle. Next him was my uncle,
and below, Dick, facing Tom&#8217;s wife. All
these were capital photographs, and made
me laugh. On the next pages were, on
the left a photograph of Theresa, and on
the right a portrait of Conny. I had
now my two cousins before me, and could
compare them. Conny looked indescribably
pretty, in spite of a somewhat affected
<i>pose</i>. Teazer&#8217;s face was in profile, and a
handsome profile it was. There was plenty
of intellect in the low, square brow, over
which the plentiful dark hair was roughly
drawn. The eyelashes were long, but
contributed little of tenderness to the
determined gaze of the large eye. The
contour of the bust was noble. She held
a stout riding-whip across her shoulder,
as a man holds a gun. Yet there was
something very striking about this photograph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I caught myself examining it
intently and not without admiration;
though when my eye reverted to the
sunny-haired beauty on the other page,
my heart welcomed the sweeter attraction
that drew it away from the fascination of
the stern and handsome Teazer.</p>

<p>All at once the door was violently
pushed open, and in walked the lady of
the pistol! I closed the album and
stood up. She gave me a manly nod,
though such a figure as hers ought to
have been capable of the most graceful
and sweeping bow in the world, and said,
&#8220;Are you my cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;that is,
if you are Theresa Hargrave.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this she made no reply, but stood
for some moments with a curling lip,
examining me from head to foot in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
manner the most depressing to my self-conceit
that can well be imagined.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I honoured her with a
similar inspection. Her portrait scarce]y
did her justice&mdash;it made her a brunette;
whereas, her skin was delicately fair,
though her eyes were dark and piercing,
and her hair brown. She had a full red
underlip, a fine tinge of red upon her
cheeks, a straight Greek nose, and finely
arched eyebrows. She held herself perfectly
erect. I unhesitatingly admitted,
in spite of the prejudice her extraordinary
behaviour excited in me, that she was a
strikingly handsome girl; but I sought in
her face in vain for some sign of the
capacity of tender impulse and the
womanly characteristics her father had
claimed for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you afraid of me just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
now?&#8221; she enquired without a smile.
&#8220;You must be a very nervous person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you for your
good opinion,&#8221; I replied loftily. And
then conceiving that her singular manner
was assumed, perhaps, for the purpose of
raising a laugh at me, I said, &#8220;A very
brave man might be allowed to feel a
little timid on seeing a loaded pistol
levelled at his head. But perhaps you
mistook surprise for fear. You see, I
was quite unprepared for your very noisy
reception. I had heard much of your
skill as a marksman, but I had no idea
you were possessed of such immense
courage as to shoot at a guest from behind
a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bumpkin!&#8221; she muttered, turning
on her heel and throwing herself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
decidedly inelegant posture on the sofa.
&#8220;You may sit down if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted her polite invitation, but
with so perplexed a face that I could
almost believe the expression on it
merited the contemptuous gaze she
fastened on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the governor?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she exclaimed petulantly.
&#8220;Did you never hear a father called
governor before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, very often. I believe your
governor has gone in search of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need to whistle for a
dog when he&#8217;s at your feet, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that would be a waste of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you ever in these parts before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These parts?&#8221; said I, not quite sure
that I had heard her rightly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;If my father had told me you were
deaf, I&#8217;d have ordered a speaking-trumpet
ready for your visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not deaf. On the contrary, I
am afflicted with a most torturing sensibility
of hearing. In answer to your
question, let me say that I never was in
these parts before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do? Are you clever?
Can you draw, and spell, and read?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was sure now that she was laughing
at me, but I thought her taste execrable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be certain about my spelling,&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;but I believe I can read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re a mere boy!&#8221; she exclaimed
with a loud laugh. &#8220;No wonder
you&#8217;re afraid of noises!&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to wish that my uncle would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
come in. I was really alarmed by the
girl&#8217;s extravagance. There was something
indescribably impudent in her manner
and a slanginess in her speech, to say
nothing of its grammatical deficiencies,
that was inexpressibly repulsive to me.
Uncle Tom had suggested that she wanted
taming, but that word suggested nothing.
She stood in need of greater discipline
than taming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you brought any messages
for me from Grove End?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be thought rude; but
really, you seem a perfect stick, without
a word to say for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pistol has blown all my confidence
out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think me rather outspoken, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like outspoken people?
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray give me a little time. We
scarcely know each other yet. By-and-by
I may turn out as outspoken as you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! My father told me you have
come here with the intention of being
agreeable. I hope you won&#8217;t be. I shall
expect to be treated as a woman, not as
an overgrown child, who is only happy
when she is sucking sugar-candy. I
have got some intellect, my father says,
and I&#8217;ll trouble you to respect me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This extraordinary speech she delivered
with a most consummately grave face.
Had I detected but the faintest twinkle
in her eye, I should have made up my
mind to treat the reception she was giving
me as a joke, and enter into the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of her badinage, offensive as the taste
was that could dictate it. But her gravity
was not to be mistaken. Like the country
girl of the play, she appeared to have
neither tact nor breeding enough to restrain
or moderate the violent and sudden
exhibition of her character; and I sat
listening to and watching her with much
such mingled emotions of astonishment
and disgust, as would no doubt possess
me, were I compelled to make love to
a female chimpanzee.</p>

<p>I was spared the trouble of hunting
after some suitable answer to her singular
remarks by the entrance of her father.
He came in, saying that he had been
giving orders to the servants to hurry
forward with the dinner, which was faithfully
promised by five o&#8217;clock; and then
going up to his daughter, he exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;Teazer, what on earth made you play
Charlie so vile a trick? He tells me
you fired a pistol at him! He will have
to possess an uncommon share of good
sense, not to suspect that he has been
invited to a menagerie, if you don&#8217;t
behave yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray say no more about it,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Theresa fixed her shining eyes upon
me, and I suspected, from the expression
on her face, that she was going to &#8220;let
out&#8221; at me in violent and powerful language.
Instead of which she looked at
her father, with a smile, and answered
gently,</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought all visits of state and ceremony
were celebrated by discharges of
artillery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, you were very wrong,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
said her father, turning his head aside
to conceal a grin. &#8220;I can only promise
you Charlie&#8217;s forgiveness on one condition&mdash;that
you will never be guilty of such
folly again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more I encountered her eyes fixed
upon me, haughtily and angrily; and,
anxious to conciliate her, I entreated my
uncle to change the subject, assuring him
that so far from being offended, I was
only too pleased that Theresa should treat
me <i>sans ceremonie</i>.</p>

<p>This handsome speech produced no impression
on her whatever. She continued
staring at me for some moments, in a
way that appeared to me almost indelicate;
then sneered, tossed her head, and
asked me &#8220;to hand her that book near
my elbow on the table.&#8221; I obeyed her,
and noticed that her father watched her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with curiosity and surprise. She kept the
book open in her lap, I believe, as an
excuse not to talk; for, several times,
whilst her father and I conversed, I
caught her watching me, though she
always took care to avert her eyes and
curl her lip when I glanced at her. I
thought her a perfect Tartar, and wondered
at my uncle Tom&#8217;s extraordinary
want of penetration, in supposing that I
could ever be brought to couple myself
with such a woman.</p>

<p>She never opened her lips until the
Irish man-servant, whose name I afterwards
learnt was O&#8217;Twist, announced dinner.
I thought it odd that my cousin
made no change in her dress for the
table, but supposed that her love of ease
and freedom had long ago triumphed over
all fiddling restraints of etiquette.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>I rose and offered her my arm; but as
I approached, she swept her dress away
from me, and exclaimed in a low tone,
&#8220;When I want a crutch, I&#8217;ll buy one.
I have still the use of both my legs,
thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>I will leave you to imagine my feelings.
&#8220;She may have a handsome person,&#8221;
thought I, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be hanged if she
hasn&#8217;t the soul of a kangaroo!&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle, who was near the door when
she made her overwhelming remark, and
therefore could not have heard it, led the
way to the dining-room. I caught him
looking behind as if rather surprised that
I hadn&#8217;t his daughter on my arm; but
this, after a moment&#8217;s reflection, I concluded
to be a mere fancy.</p>

<p>She took a seat opposite me, and whilst
her father said grace, smiled over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
shoulder at O&#8217;Twist, whose eyes were on
me. I had very little doubt that she was
not in her right senses, and marvelled at
the blindness of her father in attributing
virtues to her which seemed so entirely
absent from her nature, that I could not
conceive how he had imagined their
existence. He made as good a host as
Tom; but though the dinner was first-rate,
the wines superior to any my uncle
Tom had, I never in all my life felt so
miserable nor enjoyed my food less. That
confounded O&#8217;Twist, who stood behind his
master&#8217;s chair, scarcely ever removed his
eyes from my face. I tried once to stare
him out, but the longer I looked the
more intent became his gaze. The discomfort
his groggy eyes caused me I
cannot describe. What, I kept thinking,
<i>what</i> is there about me to provoke such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
insolence? Am I in a madhouse? Have
I mistaken my way, and found a welcome
in an asylum for lunatics?</p>

<p>My uncle talked incessantly. The more
agitated and dispirited I became, the more
he plied me with his recollections, with
stories of his doings in his young days,
of actors and authors, of noble lords and
needy parasites. Whether it was that he
was spoiled in my esteem by the outrageous
behaviour of his daughter and
servant, or that I regarded him as heading
a conspiracy against my peace of
mind, I did not find half so much to like
in him as I had at Grove End. He, it is
true, could not see O&#8217;Twist&#8217;s behaviour,
as the rude creature stood behind his
chair; and queer as his daughter&#8217;s manners
were, I could not reasonably expect him
to chide her before me. But these considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gave me no encouragement.
Now and then he would stay his monologue
to ask Theresa for a date or a name,
and she answered him readily enough;
but to <i>my</i> questions and remarks she
seldom vouchsafed a longer answer than
yes or no.</p>

<p>Shortly after the dessert was placed
upon the table she left the room, and to
my great relief was followed by O&#8217;Twist.
Vexed as I was, my politeness would not
suffer me to make any comments on her
behaviour. Had her father questioned me
I should have been candid enough; but
throughout our after-dinner chat he never
mentioned her name, but confined his
remarks entirely to books and pictures, or
told stories, over which I should have
roared as heartily as he, perhaps, had I
been in a better temper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>When we had smoked our cigars out,
he invited me to see his grounds. I
consented, having made up my mind to
convert myself into a perfectly passive
agent for him and his daughter to do
what they chose with, whilst I remained
at Thistlewood, which, I registered a secret
vow, should not be for long. He peeped
into the drawing-room on passing across
the hall, and, seeing his daughter, entered
and called to me, &#8220;Teazer shall sing us
a song before we go out. You&#8217;ll get none
of your die-away ballads here, Charlie.
My girl has my taste, and stubbornly
refuses to learn any song tainted with the
least suggestion of molly-coddleism; eh,
Teazer? Come, my dear, what shall it
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked to the piano at once, with
the air of a person who has a very disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
task to perform, but who knows
that the sooner it is begun the sooner it
will be over. The first thing she did was
to knock the stool down. I instantly
darted forward to pick it up, but she
whispered angrily, &#8220;I am accustomed to
help myself, thanks!&#8221; and set it upright
with a smart bang. I paid her the
compliment of considering that she was
purposely clumsy in her movements, for
she seemed to forget her ungainly part
when seating herself, which she did with
perfect but unconscious grace. I earnestly
hoped she did not propose to play from
music, for I dreaded the prospect of
having to stand by her and turn over
the pages, being ignorant of my notes,
and only knowing when to turn by following
the performer&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>She struck the piano, and I breathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
freely. But anything more distressing
and feeble than her performance I never
listened to. Why, Conny was a Patti
and a Thalberg rolled into one compared
to her! The song she sung was &#8220;Cease,
rude Boreas,&#8221; of all the songs ever written,
the one, to my mind, the least suitable
for a woman&#8217;s voice. She was for ever
striking the wrong notes, pausing often to
cough or think, and singing with such
ludicrous affectation, that it cost me an
immense effort to preserve my gravity.
Her father lost patience at the end of
the first stanza, and exclaimed, &#8220;What&#8217;s
the use of asking Boreas to cease, when
all the while you&#8217;re raising a worse
squall than ever he was known to
blow? I never heard you sing like this
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate singing,&#8221; she answered, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from the music-stool, which she overturned
again. This time I didn&#8217;t offer to pick it
up. Neither did she; and thus I was
placed in an abominably awkward position,
for her father, of course, wondered
at my want of manners.</p>

<p>&#8220;How awkward you are!&#8221; he exclaimed,
peevishly, making a tremendous
but futile effort to reach the stool
himself.</p>

<p>She laughed, and coolly put the stool
on end with her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll finish the song if my cousin
likes,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. He&#8217;s had enough of
it, I&#8217;ll warrant. Come along into the
garden, my boy, and let us breathe some
fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we went out, he said: &#8220;How
wretchedly my daughter sang! Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
you believe that she has a fine contralto
voice, and can play the piano brilliantly?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was amazed by his perverse partiality,
which persisted in attributing all
kinds of graces and perfections to a girl
who seemed to me to be wanting in
everything but a good figure and a
handsome face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she was nervous,&#8221; said I,
secretly ridiculing the absurdity of my
remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that was the reason,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;although she <i>is</i> nervous.
She is courageous in many things&mdash;would
ride in a steeple-chase, let off a cannon,
or handle a spider. But in society she
is very bashful and shy, will shrink
within herself if she finds that she attracts
attention (which she generally does), and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I really believe, would prefer to lead
a forlorn hope up a hill, than parade
to and fro before rows of lookers-on,
such as you get at the seaside, and in
public gardens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t give me the impression of
being nervous in any sense,&#8221; I answered,
thinking how true was the saying,
that the last person to know a child&#8217;s
character was the parent.</p>

<p>The subject was changed by his asking
me what I thought of the grounds.
I praised everything. I had made up my
mind to reverse the Horatian precept,
and do nothing but admire. However,
the grounds really deserved my admiration.
They were richly wooded, lavishly
stocked, covering altogether not less than
fifteen acres. My uncle was very communicative
and affectionate, held my arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as we wandered, and gave me a long
account of his early life, his prejudices,
tastes, and present love of seclusion. He
had but very few neighbours, which, he
said, was one great reason for his purchasing
the property.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have outlived my love of society,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;The friends I cared for
are gone, and I have neglected Johnson&#8217;s
advice to keep friendship in repair by
forming new attachments. Dinner parties
and balls are no treats to me. The tone
of society has changed wonderfully within
the last twenty years. There is little or
no conversation, no friendly rivalries of
wit, none of that heartiness which used
to make our old social gatherings so
enjoyable. However, I have little to
complain of. No man can be alone who
has his books. Do you remember what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Macaulay says of them? &#8216;These are the
old friends who are never seen with new
faces, who are the same in wealth and in
poverty, in glory and obscurity. With
the dead there is no rivalry. In the
dead there is no change.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t your daughter care for
society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If she did she should have
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does she pass the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In sewing, and reading and writing:
and latterly in shooting. You smile!
Well, shooting does seem a queer pastime
for a young lady to indulge in, but I
really don&#8217;t see why a girl shouldn&#8217;t
amuse herself with a pistol if she has
the courage. My objection is not a conventional
one. I fear that she will one
day injure herself. But for that, I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
discover no reason why a girl living in
the country shouldn&#8217;t shoot at a mark,
as girls frequently in town amuse themselves
by shooting in saloons erected for
that purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the revolver her own that I saw
in her hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is mine. She took it out
of my bed-room, and has kept it ever
since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she as fond as you of books?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a great reader,&#8221; he answered
with a smile that seemed like an admission
of my peculiar right to make
these enquiries. &#8220;I am sometimes quite
astonished by the information she
possesses in directions which even professed
students find too dry and uninviting
to pursue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
delusion he is labouring under! I would
bet a hundred pounds Theresa couldn&#8217;t
write a dozen lines that shouldn&#8217;t contain
half as many blunders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus conversing, we reached the
stables, where I found three fine horses,
one of which he pointed out as his
daughter&#8217;s. This supplied him with a
text for a long discourse on the subject
of breeding horses; he then branched
off into topics connected with the Stock
Exchange, and finally, after an absence
of nearly an hour, reconducted me to the
house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2></div>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8217;Twas night, calm night, the moon was high.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap"><i>Ancient Mariner.</i></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Teazer</span> and I had very little to say to
each other for the rest of the evening.
I was really so afraid of her that I had
not the courage to be polite. When I
offered to take her cup from her, she
looked at me so angrily and clung to
the saucer so tenaciously that I might
well have thought she regarded me as a
thief, who wanted to make away with
her father&#8217;s crockery. Her manners were
deplorably vulgar. She lay back in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
arm-chair, and stuck her legs out in
such a way that I wondered her father
didn&#8217;t jump up and kick them in.</p>

<p>And what extraordinary delusion could
he be labouring under in believing her
well-read? He left the room for a short
time during the evening, and finding
myself alone with my half-civilised cousin,
I felt myself under an obligation to
address her. Willing to take her father&#8217;s
word that she was well-read, I thought
I would get her upon the subject of
books, and asked her that very tea-party
question, who was her favourite
author.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Family Herald,&#8217;&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>I burst into a laugh. Her reply was
so ridiculous, that I couldn&#8217;t have preserved
my gravity had she even produced
her revolver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>&#8220;Your papa told me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that
you are a very great reader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what right have you to doubt
his word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t think I do,&#8221; I stammered,
rendered somewhat apprehensive by a
gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you laugh at me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were laughing at
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t flatter yourself,&#8221; she exclaimed,
with an air of great contempt. &#8220;I must
like people to laugh at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Offended, and even disgusted, I turned
away from her; but looking round a
moment after, with the intention of
speaking, I caught her smiling, though
the smile instantly vanished when our
eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hargrave, it is very plain,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I, &#8220;that I am an unwelcome guest. Had
I foreseen the annoyance my intrusion
would have caused you, I should certainly
not have accepted your father&#8217;s
invitation. However, I must entreat you
to bear with me until to-morrow, when
I will take care to please you by returning
to Updown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not asked you to go,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;You are not my guest, but
my father&#8217;s. He asked you down for
himself, not for me; so, providing you
don&#8217;t trouble me, you may stop as long
as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble you!&#8221; I exclaimed, warmly.
&#8220;How have I troubled you? I have
only been in the house a few hours.
But I can remedy that by asking your
father to allow me to use the library, or
any room but this, until the train leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to-morrow, and then we need not
meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are not going to turn out
a tale-bearer, and set my father against
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in heaven&#8217;s name do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are quite welcome to swear,
sir. But let me assure you, I am not to
be frightened by oaths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oaths!&#8221; I stammered. But what
use reasoning with a woman who manifestly
was not in possession of her
reason? I considered that I had been
already a great deal too condescending.
I had forgotten my dignity, and provoked
a most audacious snubbing by an
amiability that was totally at variance
with those high and splendid conceptions
which had hitherto characterised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
my self-estimates. No wonder my aunt
had guessed that I would not like
Teazer. &#8220;Teazer!&#8221; That was a dog&#8217;s
name, and it suited my cousin to perfection.
But did she behave to everybody
as she behaved to me? Impossible.
She wouldn&#8217;t have a friend. Perhaps
she hadn&#8217;t. Perhaps her temper and
gross manners were the real cause of
her father&#8217;s retired life; and yet, hadn&#8217;t
I heard from somebody or other that
she had had admirers, and received
even an offer of marriage from an individual
whose name figured in Debrett&#8217;s
List? Nonsense! this must have been
said merely to put me in conceit with
the girl, and set me on the high road
to courtship. Why, the cook down-stairs
could teach her better manners than she
had. It was a great pity. I felt sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for her. She was, undeniably, good-looking;
her eyes magnificent&mdash;splendid
contradictions to her character. Watching
her, when she was silent, I could
have sworn, had I not known the truth
about her nature, that she really possessed
the profound passions and fine
qualities her father strangely found in
her. Though she threw her arms and
legs about in the wildest search after
inelegance, the utmost uncouthness of
posture could scarcely deform or even
qualify the inexpressible suggestions of
grace with which her noble form was
full fraught.</p>

<p>Her father came in with his hearty
smile, and I envied him the affectionate
glance he received from her. How was
it that she could never look at me
without a sneer or a frown? What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
there in me to challenge her contempt?
If there was one thing I used to pique
myself upon more than another, it was
my success with the ladies. At Longueville
I was always in request. No
picnic was planned, no ball or open-air
<i>fête</i> given, in which my name was not
conspicuous. I shall not be accused of
blabbing, if I modestly assert that, on
Valentine&#8217;s Day, I would receive as
many as twenty letters, many of which
were original poetry: and, on New
Years&#8217; Day, was I ever forgotten by
Eugenie, by Sophie, by Marie, or by
Celestine? Teazer was my St. Helena.
What satisfaction in recalling my victories,
the loving sighs and ogles that
attended my gilded progress, now that
my charms were exiled and lodged upon
a barren rock?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Bah! what need I care? wasn&#8217;t I in
love with Conny? wasn&#8217;t I pledged to
that golden-haired goddess? Bore I in
my heart no memory of her deep, deep
eyes, to compensate me for the contempt
that gleamed in Teazer&#8217;s gaze, for
the sneers that curled her decidedly
beautiful lip? I might regret that she
had not found me as conquering as
<i>others</i> had done, that on my return to
Updown I might bare my heart to
Conny, and cry, &#8220;Behold! here are thy
lineaments&mdash;thine only! Arrows barbed
by beauty have been shot by eyes the
most entrancing, and have glanced harmless
from the adamant on which love
hath painted in imperishable colours thy
transcendent graces!&#8221; I say, it was
only for Conny&#8217;s sake that I regretted
Theresa didn&#8217;t find me irresistible. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
vanity was not concerned&mdash;oh, certainly
not. It was nothing to me&mdash;a young
man&mdash;that a handsome woman should
treat me as a baboon. Oh, no, nothing.
My pride bled&mdash;for Conny.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock Theresa went to bed.
She gave me a finger to shake, but
embraced her father as if he were her
lover.</p>

<p>We were now in the parlour with
cigars and spirits on the table. O&#8217;Twist,
on placing these refreshments before us,
had stared at me in the most outrageous
manner. I could have punched his
head, so angry did his insolence make
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that fellow mad?&#8221; I asked my
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His trick of staring. At dinner his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
eye-balls stood out a foot beyond his
cheeks, so intent was his gaze. Is he
a Fenian, and does he mistake me for
a constable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh, this is your fancy, my
dear boy. O&#8217;Twist is the most harmless,
good-natured creature in the whole
world, and the politest. Corpulent as
he is, I can assure you, on occasions
he can comport himself with the dignity
of a Lord Mayor. He often blunders,
but as often recovers himself with
capital Irish humour and grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle is a most extraordinary
person, I thought. Whatever I find
fault with he commends, and strangely,
commends for the very qualities that
are most wanting. I had too much
good taste to pass any remarks upon
his daughter&#8217;s behaviour to me; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
doing his utmost to make me comfortable,
and it would be in the highest
degree ungracious to grumble at this
early stage. Yet as I was fully persuaded
he had remarked his daughter&#8217;s
manner, I was much surprised that he
did not offer some excuses for it. Of
course I could understand his silence
on the motive of my visit. If I didn&#8217;t
begin the subject, he couldn&#8217;t. It was
for me to fall in love with Theresa,
and make her in love with me; until
the pie was made, he couldn&#8217;t very
well put his finger in it. Let me
confess I was heartily glad that delicacy
<i>did</i> restrain him. Had he started the
topic, in all probability I should have
said something to offend him, for in
the mood that then possessed me, nothing
could have been more objectionable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a reference to my uncle Tom&#8217;s wild and
preposterous scheme.</p>

<p>He talked to me a good deal about
his brother&#8217;s bank and banking in
general, and sounded my knowledge of
the business with a great number of
questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You quite justify Tom&#8217;s opinion of
you,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I should never
have thought you capable of acquiring
so much information in so short a space
of time. Banking is a very fine business,
and if Tom takes you into partnership,
which he talks of doing, I see no reason
why you shouldn&#8217;t become a very rich
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the nearest approach to his
brother&#8217;s &#8220;scheme&#8221; which he made. I
listened, expecting him to begin on the
subject of my marriage with his daughter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
but he immediately changed the conversation
by inviting me to make myself
thoroughly at home while I stayed with
him, to call for anything I wanted, to
use his horses&mdash;in short, to treat him
as I treated my uncle Tom, &#8220;than
which,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I shall expect no
better compliment from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wished, secretly, that he would not
be so hospitable, for the kinder he was,
the harder it would be to find an excuse
to get away from the house.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock I began to yawn,
and seeing this, he conducted me to my
bed-room. &#8220;We have no fixed breakfast
hour,&#8221; said he, &#8220;so you may choose
your own time to leave your bed. I
rarely close my eyes before half-past four,
and am therefore seldom up before ten.
But Teazer is usually down by half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
eight, so you may depend upon finding
somebody to look after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook hands with him, and he went
away. I felt more wearied than sleepy.
The night was very sultry, and I threw
my window wide open before getting
into bed. A brilliant moon rode high,
and whilst I watched it I thought of
Conny, and wondered if her dear eyes
were upon it, and if she were thinking
of me. Sweet girl! I pictured her
delicate features upturned to the benign
light, and the chastity they would take
in the radiance. What a contrast between
the two cousins! What a pity Theresa
was so unmannerly! Her face haunted
me. I am afraid it sometimes eclipsed
Conny&#8217;s. How came it so gross a mind
should be so finely clothed? From what
did her eyes take their fire? Surely not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
from her heart. After all, what was she
but a handsome animal? She could
shoot, she could ride; she was very fit
for the backwoods. What a wretched
voice she had! what a feeble touch!
And her father declared she could play
and sing well! How slangy her language
was, how beautiful her complexion, how
inelegant her movements, how perfect her
figure, how&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Here I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I could hardly have slept longer than
half-an-hour, when I started up broad
awake, and stared about me. The moon
was still high; the room was filled with
its light.</p>

<p>What had awakened me?</p>

<p>Here something knocked three times
upon the door. I presumed that the
knocks fell upon the door; but, for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I knew, the sounds might have come
from the floor, the ceiling, or the walls.</p>

<p>Here was an old house! Had it a
ghost?</p>

<p>I sat upright in my bed, meaning to
wait until the knocks sounded again before
I called &#8220;Come in.&#8221; To my horror, the
handle of the door was turned with
exquisite caution, and the door was
opened stealthily.</p>

<p>Burglars! I thought, and instantly
looked towards the fender.</p>

<p>A short fat man in his shirt, with
braces hanging loosely about his breeches,
stepped into the room, but on catching
sight of me, fell back a step and stood
staring. It was O&#8217;Twist. The moonlight
made him deadly white, and I scarcely
knew him in his undress.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; I gasped, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
doubting that the man had hoped to
find me asleep, and to steal my watch
and purse, and perhaps to murder me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tort I&#8217;d look in to see if you were
all right, sor,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! what do you mean? I was
asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrue, sor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he advanced, went to the window,
pulled down the sash, and drew the
curtains. I was so much amazed by his
actions that I could barely articulate.
Was he walking in his sleep? Impossible.
Somnambulists can&#8217;t converse. Was he
labouring under a sudden and severe
access of insanity? Idiot that I was to
leave my razor exposed on the dressing
table!</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; I gurgled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Preevinting the moon from shoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
upon your honour&#8217;s head,&#8221; he replied,
gazing complacently round him, and
then moving towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the moon got to do with
you?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I always sleep with
my window open in summer. How dare
you close it without my leave, or enter
my room at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Niver moind, sor, niver moind,&#8221; he
answered soothingly and blandly. &#8220;Your
honour will be grateful to me in the
marning whin you foind oi&#8217;ve saved yer
from taking cowld.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so saying, he walked out of the
room, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed in a great passion,
pulled back the curtain, flung the sash
up, and then went to the door, intending
to lock it, and save myself from the
villain&#8217;s intentions, whatever they were;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but to my deep annoyance I found there
was no key. To remedy this, I thrust
a chair under the handle, and a small
table against the chair, and got into bed,
puzzling my brains over the fellow&#8217;s
design, and wondering what my uncle
would think, when I told him that his
sleek O&#8217;Twist was a midnight ruffian.
&#8220;May I be hanged twenty times over,
if I don&#8217;t sleep at Updown to-morrow
night,&#8221; I growled, kicking about under
the single sheet, and wishing my uncle
Dick, and Teazer, and his house, and his
servants, and everything that belonged
to him in Jehanum.</p>

<p>My anger, however, didn&#8217;t prevent me
from falling asleep. In truth, I had
been thoroughly tired by my journey,
my walk from the station, the great
heat, and the fatiguing dance my uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had led me through the grounds. But
I was not to sleep long. A violent
crash awoke me, and my first impression
was that the house had been struck by
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>I hopped out of bed wide awake,
and stood watching the fat figure of
O&#8217;Twist, who was picking up the chair
and table he had knocked over in
pushing open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be off!&#8221; I shouted, darting at him.</p>

<p>He skipped aside, his braces trailing
in his wake, but instead of leaving the
room, seized a chair, which he brandished
with both hands, crying, &#8220;You&#8217;d betther
not touch me! I&#8217;m a moorderous man
whin my blood is up! you&#8217;d betther
not touch me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you,&#8221; I gasped, &#8220;if you
don&#8217;t leave this room at once! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
<i>dare</i> you intrude upon me a second
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me shut the window, sor&mdash;let
me pull the curtains tew&mdash;you&#8217;ll be
much aisier in you&#8217;re moind wid de
moon hid&mdash;indade you will, sor,&#8221; he
answered, jamming himself into a
corner and holding the chair over his
head.</p>

<p>I looked at him aghast. It was quite
clear to me that he was raving mad.
The moonlight had penetrated his brain,
and he was clamouring to have it hid!
Wasn&#8217;t it well known, that all mad
people raged when the moon was full?
I mustn&#8217;t be violent. No, no. He must
be humoured, or he might dash my
brains out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said I, &#8220;if I close the
window and draw the curtains, will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
promise not to break in upon me
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll promise to kape the moon
hid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to get rid of you,&#8221; I said;
&#8220;but I pledge you my word of honour,
if you break your promise I&#8217;ll throw you
out of the window. Hear that! and
to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But I checked myself. I had threatened
enough. I might drive him frantic.
There was no key to the door, and
nothing could keep him from crawling in
and cutting my throat, should I again
fall asleep, but the bed or the chest of
drawers against the door, neither of which
I was able to stir.</p>

<p>He put the chair down cautiously,
edged towards the window, watching me
intently, whilst I backed from him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he approached, watching <i>him</i> intently,
pulled down the sash, drew the curtains,
and slided sideways towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kape your word, sor?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you had better keep yours,
or look out!&#8221;</p>

<p>He closed the door, and I was again
left alone.</p>

<p>A long time passed before I fell asleep.
I never expected for a moment that
this madman would not once more pop
his vile head in to see if the moon was
hid, and lay for a great while in a state
of passionate anxiety waiting for him to
appear, that I might spring upon and
beat him. Gradually the moonshine
passed off the window, and the room
grew dark. Then another kind of light
began to creep upon the blind; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
brightened and broadened; the sparrows
twittered; and it was clear daylight
when I dropped off into a very uneasy
slumber.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the voice of
O&#8217;Twist, informing me that it was
half-past eight. I bade him in a stern
voice, which I hoped would carry terror
with it through the panels of the door,
to bring me some hot water. But he
had gone away. As I was in no temper
to lie in bed, I jumped up, meaning
to shave in cold water, then to hasten
down-stairs, give Theresa (if she were
up), a piece of my mind, wait until
my uncle left his room, that I might
acquaint him with the gross treatment
to which I had been subjected
by his servant, and then quit the
house. But when I looked for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
razor, it was gone! I was thunder-struck.
I perfectly remembered leaving
it on the toilet-table after unpacking
my travelling bag, and I was
equally sure it was in the same place
when O&#8217;Twist first entered the room, for
I recalled a cold shudder that had passed
through me on reflecting what might
happen should the maniac&#8217;s eye fasten
upon the cold steel. Had he taken it?
No doubt he had, and in all human
probability with the intention of using it
against me. What miraculous interposition
of Providence had saved my
throat?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Spark.</i> &#8220;Very droll and extravagantly comic, I must
confess; ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap"><i>The Country Girl.</i></span></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">I made</span> haste to dress, not caring a fig
that Theresa should see my beard&mdash;which
to tell the truth, owing to my
being fair, was scarcely perceptible&mdash;and
went down-stairs, keeping a sharp lookout
for O&#8217;Twist, from whom I might
have I knew not what to dread.</p>

<p>The drawing-room door was open, and
on entering, I found Theresa arranging
some freshly-picked flowers in a vase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
She instantly dropped her work on
seeing me, and exclaimed very petulantly,</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish people would knock when
they come into a room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll knock when I wear a livery,&#8221; I
replied, &#8220;not before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you sometimes wear a livery?&#8221;
she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hargrave,&#8221; I exclaimed sternly,
&#8220;I beg that you will cease your
badinage. During the short time I have
been in your house, I have had to submit
to very bad treatment. It is absurd
to pretend that the behaviour you show
to me is the behaviour you show to
others. My conviction is that you have
falsified your character only that you
may drive me back to Updown. You
have attained your end. I leave you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to-day; but I shall take care,&#8221; I added,
feeling myself grow red in the face,
&#8220;before I go, to acquaint your father
with the singular rudeness you have
been pleased to treat his guest with.
Did I imagine that you had the faintest
perception of your duty as a hostess, I
might be tempted to complain to you
of the insolence I have met with from
that scoundrel footman of yours, O&#8217;Twist.
But he has no doubt been licensed by
<i>your</i> behaviour, and thinks himself perfectly
privileged to enter my room at
night, take unwarrantable liberties with
the window, and steal my razor.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an expression on her face,
as she listened to me, which suggested
that every moment she was about to
burst into a fit of laughter. She heard
me to the end, and then said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Have you made up your mind to go
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I cried, indignantly. &#8220;I shall
only wait to see my uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said she, coolly, &#8220;I will spare
your nerves the anguish of a meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you have been in this house,&#8221;
she replied, &#8220;your behaviour to me has
been <i>most</i> insulting. You have pretended
to be deaf when I spoke to you. You
have ridiculed my book-learning. You
have, I am sure, made the most odious
comparisons between me and my cousin
Constance; and lastly, you took the unwarrantable
liberty of telling my father
of my reception of you in the avenue
yesterday, and earning me a reprimand.
I had resolved that nothing less than a
duel could wipe away the disgrace you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
have sought to cast upon me; but since
you are leaving us, I need not exact this
proof of a courage you <i>boast</i> of, but
which I thoroughly question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; I burst out. &#8220;But
you are. O&#8217;Twist is mad! you are all
mad! And if I were to stay here
another day, I should go mad too! A
duel&mdash;with a <i>woman</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray,&#8221; said she, scornfully, &#8220;don&#8217;t
try to make my sex a defence for your
fears. If you have a mind to prove
your courage, there are two pistols upstairs,
and I shall be happy to accompany
you to the back of the avenue at
once. My father will not be down for
another hour, so we need fear no interruption.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God help you!&#8221; said I. And I
added, &#8220;What a fool I was to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Grove End! There, at least, they know
how to treat a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I
am very sure that were you to behave to
Conny as you have behaved to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you aware,&#8221; I interrupted her,
&#8220;that in mentioning the name of Conny,
you are speaking of the sweetest and
most womanly of girls? who would no
more insult me as you do, than I would
knowingly insult you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like her? I love her!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am. I loved her from
the moment I set eyes on her. I
would marry her to-morrow. I am only
waiting until I have taught her to
love me, to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared for a moment or two with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
an expression of profound incredulity in
her eyes; and almost immediately a deep
and burning blush overspread her cheeks.
I seemed to witness a change come over
her as astounding as any that was ever
wrought by Harlequin&#8217;s wand. &#8220;If I
had <i>only</i> known!&#8221; she exclaimed, and
hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>I stamped my foot with impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the meaning of all this?&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;What earthly motive can
these relations have for surrounding, and
bewildering, and insulting me with their
confounded conundrums?&#8221;</p>

<p>I paced about the room waiting for
Theresa to return, when I at least
expected she would enter into a full
explanation of her extraordinary behaviour.
Half-an-hour passed, and I was
still alone. The grounds looked tempting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I entered them, and began with
regular steps to measure the wide extent
of the lawn, cudgelling my brains the
while for a clue to Theresa&#8217;s conduct,
and reviling the sluggish habits of my
uncle, which delayed my hope of being
enlightened.</p>

<p>Presently O&#8217;Twist came out of the
house. He approached me with the
most humble aspect that can be figured,
and on my halting, stood still, twitching
a fore-lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I humbly ax your honour&#8217;s pardon
for de liberty I took wid your honour
last night. It wor all a mistake, sor;
and Miss Theresa&#8217;s bid me come to you
now and apoologise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by a mistake?&#8221;
I inquired, severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sor, I was desired to kape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
me eye upon you, and at night-time
to look in upon your honour in bed,
to see dat de moon didn&#8217;t shine upon
your head, sor; for I was tould dat
you were not in your right sinses,
and dat de moon so excited your
honour, dat dere was no telling what
moorderous thricks you moightn&#8217;t be
playin&#8217; wid de household.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who told you all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Theresa, and she bid me tell
you it was herself as set me to watch
you, sor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I exclaimed, a light beginning
to break. &#8220;And did she order you to
take my razor away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat was me own sthrategem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray how come you to find out
now that I am not mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yer honour, you&#8217;re not de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
gintleman Miss Theresa tort you. I&#8217;m
sure, sir, I&#8217;m very much ashamed of de
inconvainance and throuble I&#8217;ve put
your honour tew, and most humbly ax
your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here his hand vibrated at his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; say no more. I can see
you are not to blame,&#8221; I replied, inwardly
grappling with a very elusive idea that
had been suggested by the man&#8217;s
apologies. He retired, looking very contrite
and ashamed, and I resumed my
walk.</p>

<p>It was clear now that my first perceptions
of my cousin&#8217;s character were
right, and that the extravagant part she
had played was assumed, though for what
motive I had yet to learn. Before long,
O&#8217;Twist came out again, and asked me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with an air of obsequious deference, if I
would take breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;for my
uncle,&#8221; who, as I spoke, threw open his
bed-room window, waved his hand, and
called out that he would be with me in
a few minutes. Those few minutes lasted
a long time. I grew so tired of waiting;
that I returned to the house. It was
nearly half-past ten, and I had not
breakfasted! What is the meaning of
all this? I thought. Is it my uncle&#8217;s
turn now to play me a trick? At last
I heard his boots creaking on the stairs,
and he came into the room slowly, with
the air of a man oppressed with trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know how to face you,&#8221; he
exclaimed, taking my hand. &#8220;I am
ashamed of myself, ashamed of my
daughter, ashamed of my house&mdash;of everything!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I have heard the whole story
from Theresa, and have no words to
express my annoyance to think that you
should have been made the victim of so
flagrant a violation of the commonest
rules of politeness and hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I can answer you,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;pray help me out of the fog in which
I am still involved. What <i>is</i> the meaning
of all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast, sor,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Twist from
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have breakfasted!&#8221;
exclaimed my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not breakfasted! and how long is it
since you left your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven forgive us!&#8221; he groaned; &#8220;it
is not enough that they should wantonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
insult you&mdash;they mean to starve you as
well! Come!&#8221; he cried, catching me
by the arm, and hurrying me into the
dining-room, &#8220;not a word&mdash;not a word
until you have breakfasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>His distress was really genuine; and I
felt for him. I could not better show
my sympathy than by attending to his
requests; and so, without a word, fell to
the capital repast before me. For his
part, he ate little or nothing; all his
time was employed in watching me; and
had I been wronged in the most atrocious
manner, I don&#8217;t think his face could have
expressed keener remorse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray,&#8221; said I, at last, &#8220;don&#8217;t allow a
trifle like this to vex you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; he answered, wiping his
forehead with an immense pocket-handkerchief;
&#8220;I am fifty-five years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and this is the very first occasion in my
life on which a guest of mine has had
reason to complain of the treatment
he has received under my roof. Were
you a stranger to me, the indignities
that have been heaped upon you would
be felt by me keenly enough; but you
are my brother&#8217;s son, and have a particular
claim upon our kindness. I consider
that no apologies we can make
ought to entitle us to your forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really judge the matter too seriously.
If I had less conceit and more
penetration, I should have seen at once
that Theresa was acting a feigned part.
But where is she? I don&#8217;t think she
has breakfasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is hiding her face for shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please beg her not to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the most extraordinary creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
on the face of the earth,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;What do you think was
her reason for making such a donkey of
herself? She has told me her story&mdash;and,
as you have finished breakfast,
you shall hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed his chair from the table,
and began to speak with great energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was under the impression that
you had come here with the intention
of making love to, and marrying her.
I had previously told her exactly the
nature of your uncle Tom&#8217;s scheme, and
that I liked it, and should be well
pleased to see it carried out. She heard
me without offering a single remark.
She asked no questions about you&mdash;but
simply inquired when you were coming.
And now she has confessed to me that
she was determined not to be married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to any man by <i>contrivance</i>. I knew
she had a proud nature&mdash;but I never
suspected she was so silly as to suppose
that, unless she should really love you
well enough to be your wife, I should
wish her to marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I cried: &#8220;then her object
was to disgust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely; and what does the minx
do? She hangs about the avenue until
she spies you coming, and then salutes
you with a pistol shot! She repels your
politeness with the most uncouth rudeness!
In order still further to embarrass
and disgust you, she coolly tells
O&#8217;Twist that you are not always in your
right senses, and desires him to keep
his eye on you whenever he has the
opportunity of doing so, particularly
during meal-times, lest you should snatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
up a knife, and attempt to murder one
of us! A better tool than O&#8217;Twist for
her sorry purposes she couldn&#8217;t have hit
upon. He is not only credulous, but
superstitious, and, but for this discovery,
would have teazed your soul out of you.
The idiot believes every word she says,
and obeys her injunctions with even more
zeal than she could have hoped for. She
had told him to enter your room at
night (not doubting he would awaken
and terrify you), and pull down your
blind, should he find it up, lest the
moonshine should unduly excite you.
The trick was so far clever, that she
might depend at least upon both of you
thinking the other mad. God knows
how the joke might have ended, had
you lost your temper. Then again,
when I ask her to play and sing, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
breaks into hideous noises, so resolved
is she that you shall think her repulsive
in every possible point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Not from every point of
view&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t deform her beauty.
But the truth is, she wanted to drive
me out of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was her object; and it is
impossible to conjecture what other tricks
she might not have played you, had you
not told her you were in love with
Conny.&#8221; (I blushed. Somehow or other
I felt ashamed that <i>he</i> should know
this.) &#8220;<i>Then</i> her false character fell
from her. She saw the blunder she
had perpetrated, the unnecessary cruelty
of her tricks; her own conduct terrified
her, and I pledge you my word, when
I left her, she was crying like a
child.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, pray,&#8221; I cried, starting up, &#8220;let
me go and assure her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her cry,&#8221; he interrupted me.
&#8220;There may be more hysteria than
remorse in her tears&mdash;though I am sure
she is sorry enough. She imposed too
heavy a part on herself; the imposture
was too much for her strength. She
never could have persisted in it. Her
true nature would have broken through
and would have betrayed her extraordinary
motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While her deception lasted, it was
very clever. I really gave her credit
for being the unmannerly young person
she enacted. To be sure, I found it
hard to reconcile her beauty with her
gross behaviour, and, no doubt, had she
carried on her deceit much longer, I
should have found her out. But, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that could have happened, she would
have gained her object, for I had fully
made up my mind to leave you
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I wouldn&#8217;t have permitted
it. I noticed that her behaviour
was very extraordinary; but to tell you
frankly the truth, I thought the whole
thing a mere piece of coquetry. After
that singing bout of hers, I was persuaded
that her reason for acting so
strangely was merely to make her real
nature and capacities more striking, by
the force of contrast when she chose
to exhibit them. Women will descend
to any absurdities to gain admiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She evidently didn&#8217;t want me to
admire her,&#8221; said I, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the least galling part of the
business is the doubt her deceit implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of <i>me</i>. Could she&mdash;could you imagine
for a moment that I could ever
sanction her marriage with a man she
didn&#8217;t love? If she can suspect that
I would part with her on commercial
grounds only, she does me a far greater
wrong than she has done you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is her reserve that has brought
all this about,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Had she asked
a few questions, nothing could have
happened to trouble us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>is</i> reserved&mdash;shy, as I told you&mdash;and
confoundedly proud. She owned
to me just now, that the idea of her
becoming your wife in order to carry out
her uncle&#8217;s and my wishes was abhorrent
to her. &#8216;If I am to be loved, papa,&#8217;
she said, &#8216;I must be loved without
regard to the wishes or objections of
outsiders.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;My views exactly,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;I
never came here with the intention of
making love to her. I wanted to know
her and enjoy your hospitality and
society, and uncle Tom could have no
right to expect more from me. I always
was and always shall be opposed to
marriages &#8216;of convenience,&#8217;&#8221; I continued
warmly. &#8220;A man and a woman are
brought together without love, without
sympathy, without probably one interest
in common, save that of mutual disgust.
How can they be happy? You may
tell them that their marriage will fill
their pockets with money; but how many
pounds sterling does an ounce of pure
love cost? Where are they to go to
market for their everyday moral wants?
I am too poor, and I hope too wise to
sneer at money; but in my humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
opinion the man who should set to work
to make a map of human life, would
not blunder in putting all the best things
outside the money line.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">&#8220;A ship and a woman are ever repairing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap"><i>Jacula Prudentum.</i></span></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> conversation did not terminate with
that very fine philosophical stroke you
have just read; but it is not worth
while recording what followed, as it
consisted entirely of apologies and excuses
on my uncle&#8217;s side, and polite
protests and entreaties on mine.</p>

<p>Indeed, now that the trick was exposed
and Theresa repentant, I was inclined to
witness something exceedingly diverting
in the whole performance, and to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
my cousin no ordinary genius for so
cleverly planning and so bravely executing
a very repulsive part. I could
not quite believe that she was so repentant
as her papa represented her.
Somewhat ashamed of herself she might
indeed be, not so much on account of
her vagaries, as because she had so instantly
dropped her mask on hearing I
was in love with Conny. There was a
confession of weakness in this she would
not like to remember.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my uncle was extraordinarily
polite. The kind-hearted old man was
obviously anxious to make me all the
amends in his power. He planned a
fishing excursion, a riding party, a drive
to some famous ruins; he begged me to
suggest my own amusements. He had
an engagement at half-past eleven to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
meet some man on business at the village,
whither he asked me to accompany him.
I told him I should prefer rambling
amongst the trees in the grounds, the
truth being, I wanted to see Theresa
and become friends with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said he; &#8220;do whatever
you please. I shall be back by
lunch-time, and then we&#8217;ll think over
some way of getting rid of the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>His horse was saddled and brought to
the door; he sprang upon it in fine
style considering his great bulk, and with
a kindly nod at me, trotted slowly down
the avenue.</p>

<p>Seeing no signs of Theresa, I thought
I could not better pass the time than
by writing a description of my reception
and adventures to Conny, and went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the house meaning to settle down to a
long letter. As I passed through the
hall, I noticed the album lying upon the
table in the drawing-room. So I took
hold of the book, and, like an honest
lover that I was, fell to a maudlin
perusal of my mistress&#8217;s countenance.
But very often my eyes wandered to
Theresa&#8217;s handsome face, and though my
heart reproached me for the involuntary
judgment, I could not help confessing that
of the two cousins Conny was decidedly
the inferior in every physical respect. Nothing
more natural, of course, being a fair
man, than that when I had two pretty
girls before me, she of the dark eyes
should touch me more nearly than she
of the blue. You will understand, I am
speaking now as a connoisseur&mdash;of the
effect produced upon my mind; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a criticism with which my heart had
nothing to do.</p>

<p>I was leaving the drawing-room, <i>en
route</i> for the library, where I expected to
find pen and paper, when I met my
cousin face to face. She blushed and
stood still&mdash;I think she had imagined I
had gone out with her father&mdash;then
promptly held out her hand, which you
may believe I took readily enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of me?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, but that you are a very fine
actress, and acquitted yourself to perfection
in as difficult a part as you could
have chosen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had only told me that you
were in love with Conny, I should have
been as anxious as papa to make you
welcome,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>&#8220;We are both in an explanatory
humour,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;so let us sit down
and talk the matter out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seated herself&mdash;very differently, I
promise you, from the awkward fashion
in which she had hitherto performed that
action&mdash;her manner, indeed, was abrupt,
but that was owing to nervousness; for
the rest, she was as subdued as Katherine
after five acts of Petruchio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father tells me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you
were under the impression I had come
here to make love to you on Stock
Exchange principles, and marry you as
a commercial undertaking. Nothing under
yonder sky could be wider from the truth
than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When papa informed me of your
proposed visit,&#8221; she answered, keeping
her eyes bent downwards&mdash;and now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
she was womanly and well-behaved, I
could appreciate the surprising length of
her eyelashes, and the abundant folds of
her rich brown hair&mdash;&#8220;he quite gave me
to understand that it was his and Tom&#8217;s
wish that I should marry you. I said
nothing&mdash;but I inwardly vowed that no
earthly power should induce me to accept
a man&#8217;s hand under any other conditions
than my own. I did not wish to pain
papa by expressing the opinions I felt,
and so resolved to make you disgusted
with me, and drive you out of the house
as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You succeeded in everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; she continued,
blushing again, though meeting my eyes;
&#8220;you didn&#8217;t deserve such bad treatment.
Had you been a fop, or a silly fellow, I
should not regret tormenting you. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
you are neither, and bore your sufferings
so good-naturedly, that my conscience
pricked me every time I forced a sneer,
or answered you rudely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you treated me twenty times
more rudely than you did,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;you have said more than enough to
entitle you to the fullest forgiveness. I
applaud your motives highly, and think
so well of your resolution not to be
made love to without your consent, that
I am only surprised you should have
behaved with so much moderation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ironical. Moderation! Think
of O&#8217;Twist last night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor O&#8217;Twist! had I not thought
him mad, I should have thrashed him.
But I was really afraid not only to
raise my hand, but even to show my
indignation, not knowing what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
become of me, should the lunatic&#8217;s rage
be excited!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only repeat,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that I
am very sorry it has happened. I will
not say so again: for one apology is
enough, when you are sincere. Papa
was too emphatic. He fully impressed
me with the idea that a marriage
between us was settled, and&mdash;and I was
<i>determined</i> not to be married in such
an off-hand way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then a bright blush glowed in
those cheeks, which, a few hours before,
I could have sworn were incapable of
blushing; she tried to smile, but looked
terribly confused and nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have a great deal of
courage to handle a pistol as you do,&#8221;
said I, willing to relieve her by changing
the subject. &#8220;All the girls I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
known would rather play with a black
beetle than gunpowder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I began to shoot long before I
heard you were coming,&#8221; she answered,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. Your father says you
are a capital shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I am. You will think the
pastime very unfeminine; but it is a
caprice of mine, and papa is very indulgent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are also a very courageous rider,
I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are very few horses I should
fear to mount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Theresa, will you confess
that your favourite author is not the
&#8216;Family Herald?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed outright at this, and exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;The most wonderful part of it all
is, that I should ever have got you to
believe the nonsense I talked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no proof of my stupidity, but
of your cleverness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how rude I was!&#8221; she cried,
looking at me almost gaily, and losing
her subdued manner. &#8220;How you stared
when I refused to take your arm and to
give you my cup to put down! I was silly
to misbehave myself so to <i>you</i>; but rather
than allow any man to hang about me
with sickly compliments, owing wholly to
commercial inspirations, I would have
acted ten times more boldly and rudely,
and never have rested until I had driven
him out of the house, detesting my very
name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; said I, amused by the
gleam in her eyes, and by her recurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to some points of the character she had
discarded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t talk of it. Tell me
about yourself and Conny. Are you
engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Uncle Tom refuses his consent;
and I ought to add that Conny isn&#8217;t
positively in love with me yet&mdash;at least
she says she isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose Tom&#8217;s sanction would
trouble you much, would it?&#8221; she
asked, making me smile, not only by her
familiar reference to her uncle, but by
her off-hand manner, which, now that it
was associated with nothing of rudeness,
I found extremely agreeable, piquant, and
characteristic.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Conny loved me, her father&#8217;s consent,
I believe, would follow. Her mamma
is strongly on my side.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;I should never bother about relations&#8217;
opinions much,&#8221; said she. &#8220;People only
marry each other, not each other&#8217;s family.
Why does Tom object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve got no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pondered my reply for a little
in silence, then took up the album,
opened it at Conny&#8217;s picture, and mused
over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very pretty, isn&#8217;t she? Her
fair hair will keep her a young looking
woman when she is far beyond middle-age.
I only wonder she hasn&#8217;t married
long ago. But they live as quietly at
Grove End as we do, and their neighbours
are about as cheerful and hospitable
as ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed the album and added, &#8220;If
you marry her, I hope you&#8217;ll both be
happy. You&#8217;ll find her staunch, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sure, if once you succeed in winning her
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of that, too. What deep
eyes she has! Her character has sometimes
puzzled me. Her mind is so
nimble, that it seems to be frisking
about in a dozen meanings at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That kind of nimbleness makes a
woman charming. Your plain-speaker is
rarely followed by the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so few men of whom anything
complimentary can be said, that
there is little marvel we should shun
candid women. It would have done me
good had you continued your downright
part for a week or two; you would have
taught me to know some of my weaknesses.
As it is, I should say I have
not lost less than three pounds weight
of conceit since yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;But what have I lost? First impressions
are everything&mdash;and I question if
you will ever overcome the dislike of me
I tried to produce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so stubborn as you think.
But you hate compliments, and so I&#8217;ll
hold my tongue, lest I should be misconstrued.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this she made no reply; but, leaving
her chair, went to the window, where
she stood for a minute or two. I could
not help watching her fine figure with
admiration. Had Conny been present I
could not have admired Theresa less. I
had already heard and seen enough to
enable me to judge how odious the
character she had assumed must have
been to her, and the glad relief with
which she had flung it aside. But what
resolution was hers to give her strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to carry out so singular an imposture!
What force of character needful to beat
down and silence those instincts which,
as certainly as she was a woman, would
clamour for quite a different construction
from what she was determined I should
put upon her nature!</p>

<p>&#8220;I desired the footman,&#8221; said she,
approaching me, &#8220;to apologise to you
this morning; but in order to get him
to do so, I had to invent a little fable,
which, no doubt, you will call a fib. I
told him you were not the gentleman I
had expected&mdash;leaving him to make out
the riddle as his Irish brains best could.
In one sense, you are <i>not</i> the gentleman
I had expected. Still, unavoidable as the
equivocation was, it annoys me intensely.
True it is that one folly begets another,
and a worse. I must devise some expiation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Exact some penance&mdash;I promise
you shall be obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now where was my wit, that I didn&#8217;t
say something handsome? &#8217;Twas ever
thus. A capital answer occurred next
day. But it was too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want nothing but your good opinion.
I have innocently put you to a great
deal of trouble. All I require is your
forgiveness for having made you very
uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us shake hands and be good
friends; as cousins we ought to like each
other. And since there is no likelihood
of our being married, there is no reason
why we should be enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pressed her hand warmly, laughing
at her queer speech, and her blunt
manner; but admiring too.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in came my uncle, who had evidently
entered the house by one of the side
doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish persons would knock when they
come into a room,&#8221; I whispered with
soft significance, releasing her hand, and
catching sight of the conscious blush
with which she received the remark she
had herself greeted me with not very
long before.</p>

<p>My uncle here burst into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good friends, hey?&#8221; cried he; &#8220;now,
then, we shall be happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And running up to the piano, he
strummed and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Than which nothing could be more
ludicrously inappropriate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t coming back
until lunch-time,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met a fellow with a message from
my man to say he couldn&#8217;t meet me,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">&#8220;But now we talk of mounting steed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap"><i>Hudibras.</i></span></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> lunch I wrote to Conny. I should
like to see that letter now. I composed
it as one of Johnson&#8217;s poets wrote poetry:
&#8220;with an incessant ambition of wit;&#8221;
mentioned that little affair with O&#8217;Twist,
but made no further reference to Teazer&#8217;s
treatment (holding that both she and her
father would expect my silence); asked if
I was missed, if there was anybody at
Grove End who would particularly care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to see me back again; diversified my
pregnant sentimental &#8220;asides&#8221; with well
laboured bursts of cynicism, and concluded
four pages of close writing with a very
eloquent, &#8220;Believe me,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>As I addressed the envelope, Theresa
came into the library, and asked me if
I would ride with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should greatly enjoy a ride,&#8221; I
answered, hardily; &#8220;but you mustn&#8217;t
expect to find me a very good horseman.
However, providing my horse doesn&#8217;t
rear, I daresay I shall be able to hold
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have papa&#8217;s horse. He is
very quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could take a gate,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll keep to the main road.&#8221;</p>

<p>This being settled, she went to get on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
her habit. I was rather sorry I had no
straps by me. I am aware that they
are not much worn by riders; but depend
upon it, they are very useful to incipient
horsemen, since they prevent the trowsers
from mounting up to the knees, should
the horse grow at all distracted. Hat-guards
are also valuable. Indeed, a bad
rider ought to be sewn into his clothes;
and it would not be sometimes amiss, if
his clothes were also tacked on to the
saddle.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes&#8217; time Theresa was
ready. The horses were brought by the
groom to the door: and my cousin
mounted with fine grace. I, like a
blockhead, clambered up the wrong side;
but though my uncle, as well as the
groom and Teazer, was looking, nobody
laughed; and I had, therefore, the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of believing I had acquitted myself
well. To my great relief the animal,
under my weight, stood as motionless as
a clothes&#8217;-horse. Teazer&#8217;s, on the other
hand, began to dance, like one of your
trained brutes at a circus, when the band
strikes up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a whip, sir,&#8221; said the groom.
I jerked the reins, my uncle waved his
hand, my horse broke into a trot (I
into a perspiration), off went Teazer&#8217;s
animal sideways, I watching the lateral
beast with speechless anxiety, fearful every
moment of running into him; we got
out of the avenue into the high-road, and
away we clattered&mdash;God help me!&mdash;under
an Indian sun.</p>

<p>Teazer kept ahead of me for some ten
minutes, her horse being very nettlesome
and restive, and defying her restraint. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had settled into a good solid trot, was
growing used to the motion, and had no
wish to gallop. However, Teazer slackened
her pace after a little, and fell into a walk,
which I thought uncommonly safe and
agreeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would you like to go?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we ride to Blenhall Abbey?
We are on the road to it, and the ruins
are well worth seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here her horse sprang forward, mine
followed, and away we dashed at full
gallop, I stooping my head like a hunchback
to keep my hat on, and wondering
what pleasure people could take in having
their hearts shaken into their throats,
and their midriffs into their boots. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
use will father other things besides
those begot by sense; and before long I
not only began to discover that swift
motion was a sensation by no means disagreeable,
but found courage to raise
my head and attend to my cousin&#8217;s
figure.</p>

<p>Although, in spite of my fashionable
and aristocratic prejudices, I knew almost
nothing about riding, the stable, or the
turf, I had a good eye for picturesque
combinations and graceful movements, for
small waists and easy attitudes. I was
therefore qualified to admire Theresa on
horseback, nor did I require to be told
that she was a splendid horsewoman.
Even her man&#8217;s hat could not deform
the perfection of outline submitted to my
following gaze by her noble figure. So
much has been written about female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
riders, that all description of Theresa in
the saddle would be supererogatory, and
I will therefore save you a long account
here by briefly referring you for full information
on this important subject to
the Entertaining Library of six shillings,
two shillings, one shilling, and sixpenny
novels to be found at all bookstalls and
railway stations in town and country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you find it very hot,&#8221;
said she, checking; her horse&#8217;s canter and
dropping alongside of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather hot,&#8221; I answered, glancing
at a sky whose colour would have figured
well in a view of Palmyra. &#8220;But I am
enjoying my ride very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could give you several jumps if
you&#8217;d care about them. There are some
good hedges yonder,&#8221; and she pointed
with her whip to the plains beneath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8220;I am very well satisfied,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;Let me see! There&#8217;s the railway station,
and yonder&#8217;s the hot road I trudged along
yesterday. The view from here is very
pretty, but I fancy a ride would be
more enjoyable in the cool of the evening.
Hallo! are we to go down that
hill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Keep a firm hold of your
reins.&#8221;</p>

<p>We turned into an abominably steep
lane. I shoved my feet well out into
the stirrups, and uttered no observation
whatever until we had reached the
bottom. Then I exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a descent is enough to try the
nerves of a mule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet with nothing but level
roads now,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Are you for a
gallop?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>&#8220;No. Let&#8217;s have a talk.... How
superbly you ride, Theresa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me feel as inelegant as a
Hindoo, sitting like a tailor on an
elephant&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ridden with Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t think she rides, does
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little. She is not like me: she
is womanly in her tastes and aversions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; I exclaimed,
not quite sure whether she meant to compliment
herself or her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;She would never have played you
such a trick as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible to say. Had she misjudged
the motive of my visit to Grove
End&mdash;imagined, as you did, that I had
come to make love to her for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of her money&mdash;oh, Theresa! she might
have poisoned me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, do you think it is proper
that a girl should be made love to only
for her money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I consider it insulting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I acted wrongly in not giving myself
time to find out what sort of a man you
were, before I began my tricks. But
then it would have been too late; for
after you had seen me in my natural
capacity, as the menagerie people say,
shamming would have been ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us talk about anything that
vexes us, Theresa. Yesterday is dead
and gone, and our acquaintance dates
from this morning. But there is one
view of the question of marrying for
money which ought to be considered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Suppose a fellow falls in love with a
girl who has a fortune? doesn&#8217;t he run
a great risk of being misjudged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a girl has any sense, she will soon
see whether he is fond of her or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some men flatter so well, feign so
skilfully, appeal so dexterously to a
woman&#8217;s weaknesses, that it needs more
clear-sightedness than most girls possess
to divine either their real feelings or
their real motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fine eyes sparkled as she answered,
&#8220;That is why I hate flattery. Honest
people won&#8217;t flatter. I always look upon
a compliment as the mask of some sentiment
which would be very offensive were
it exposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an extreme view. A man may
sometimes flatter with the wish to please;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and whom should he wish to please but
his sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather not be complimented
by the man I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to be dumb, then,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will agree with you in this,&#8221; said
she, with a smile, &#8220;a girl with money
is under great disadvantages as regards
courtship and marriage. For she may
love a man whose sensitiveness finds an
obstacle in her fortune, and keeps him
back, lest a proposal should subject him
to misconstruction. Or she may meet
with a man who sincerely loves her, but
whose sincerity she distrusts because she
has money. Now a girl without money
knows very well that when an offer is
made her, she is loved only for herself.
That feeling is worth more than the
largest fortune, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; said I, &#8220;must find out the
truth for themselves, as men have to do.
Marriage is a game that takes two to
play. The man has just as much right
to suspect the girl&#8217;s sincerity, as the girl
has to suspect his. They ought, both of
them, to be above suspicion. Loyalty
begets loyalty. Where doubt is&mdash;&mdash;whoa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here my horse stumbled, and I barely
saved my hat from falling. The movement
of my horse startled hers, and
away we galloped. Talk was at an end
between us; but though many of my
faculties were engrossed by the labour
of keeping my seat, I could still think.
Was Theresa disappointed? Had she a
worm i&#8217; the bud? What made her so
sensitive about money? She talked very
candidly; but then she knew I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
love, and that knowledge conferred on
us both privileges we could hardly have
exercised had my affections been disengaged.
What a change, <i>mon Dieu!</i> from
the rude vixen of yesterday! I couldn&#8217;t
conceive a more agreeable girl than she.
Considering that she must still be embarrassed
by the memory of her behaviour
to me, her ease was wonderful, her amiability
delightful.</p>

<p>We had turned, by this time, into a
long lane, with a tall hedge on either side
of us, and plenty of trees, which, however,
did not protect us from the sun. I
have no doubt the country around looked
very beautiful, and golden and green,
with flashes of yellow light here, and
splashes of some other kind of colour
there&mdash;crammed, in a word, with a thousand
effects, such as, properly catalogued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
here, would entitle me to a place in
English fiction second only to that occupied
by the immortal author of Black&#8217;s
picturesque Guide Books. But to speak
the truth, I was thinking too much about
my neck to remark the beautiful and the
lovely; for my horse, on entering the
lane, had indescribably shocked me by
shying at an old man in a blouse, and
from that moment I was afflicted with
misgivings.</p>

<p>Happily the Ruins were at the end of
the lane. We came to an open grassy
space, my cousin halted, and pointed to
some pieces of wall here and there, supporting
what might have been the frame
of a window in the reign of St.
Lucius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! a fire!&#8221; said I, imagining
for the moment that here were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
remains of a house that had very nearly
been burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>Teazer burst into a loud laugh, the
merriest that ever made the summer air
jocund with human glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; cried she, &#8220;this is Blenhall
Abbey, the most famous ruin in the
county. I don&#8217;t know how many books
have been written about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I see the ivy now, and the
green mould about the bricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some say it was built in the reign
of Henry II., and some in Richard I.&#8217;s
time. Two gentlemen belonging to a
society came to visit it a few months
ago, and afterwards called upon papa.
That evening there was an argument.
Papa&#8217;s library was turned topsy-turvey to
prove things. One gentleman in a passion
smashed his spectacles by thumping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
fist on the table where they lay. The
best part of it was, papa has a theory
that the Abbey is of much more recent
date, and declares he can show it was
constructed in Queen Mary&#8217;s time. You
may imagine the hubbub! It ended in
all three of them becoming enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those antiquarians!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;They would wrangle for hours over a
brick fresh from a kiln, one swearing it
was made in the time of Agricola, and
another that it was the work of those
Israelites who built the pyramids. I call
those ruins rubbish, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa shrugged her shoulders affirmatively.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t tell papa I think so,&#8221;
she exclaimed with a gay laugh, wheeling
her horse round.</p>

<p>It was five o&#8217;clock when we sighted
home. On the whole, in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
heat and my nervousness, I had enjoyed
the ride. Going up the hill, a gadfly
had bitten my horse; the animal plunged,
and I gave myself up for lost. The
movement dislodged the fly, and the
horse became calm; but feeling by the
coolness in that part that my left leg
showed its sock, I did not doubt that I
had made a spectacle of myself. Judge
my surprise when Teazer congratulated me
upon the first-rate style in which I had
handled the horse. She assured me I
had saved him from falling with enviable
coolness and address; and added that she
was certain I was laughing at her when
I pretended I couldn&#8217;t ride! My conscience
smarted, but I held my tongue.
Thus, Eugenio, is honour heaped on the
undeserving. Thus do  muffs become
great by the very ignorance that ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to suppress them. Thus does the
simpleton become a field-marshal, the
ninny a bishop, the frump a privy-councillor,
the sumph a court-physician.</p>

<p>My uncle was very jolly at dinner.
He roared over my mistake about the
ruins, and brought the tears to my eyes
by his description of the two members of
the antiquarian society. It was plain that
both he and his daughter were striving
might and main to make amends for the
sufferings I had undergone on the previous
day. Teazer, perhaps, was a little bashful,
a little demure under her father&#8217;s
eye; but <i>he</i> was not to be resisted. I
daresay a good many of his stories enriched
the pages of Joe Miller; I daresay
he had told them over and over again
any time these twenty years. But what
was that to me? What anecdotes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
had, he related well. He was so anxious,
moreover, that I should be amused, that
I more than once echoed his own kindly
roar, when the best of his joke lay in
his broad, honest, hearty, British expanse
of face.</p>

<p>As to O&#8217;Twist, the man pained me
with his officiousness. He was for ever
at my ear, whispering with silvery softness,
&#8220;A little more sherry, sir?&#8221; &#8220;I
can ricommind this claret, sir;&#8221; &#8220;Will
you throy the champeene, sir?&#8221; &#8220;Perhaps
your honour would preefar the Meedeery?&#8221;
I think he wanted to make me tipsy to
show his remorse. He avoided looking at
me from motives of memory and delicacy
I could sincerely appreciate; but I could
not move without bringing him to my
side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>After dinner we went into the grounds,
where coffee was brought us.</p>

<p>This is a pretty fine life for a banker&#8217;s
clerk! thought I, stretching back in an
arm-chair and smoking one of my uncle&#8217;s
<i>Imperiales</i>, a cigar, Matilda, worth half-a-crown,
as thick as your dainty wrist, and
nearly ten inches long. Ten inches of
bliss! <i>O crudele fuoco!</i> that so much
leaf paradisaical should ever turn to
innutritious ash!</p>

<p>Yesterday I should have expected Teazer
to pull out a black cutty pipe, load it
with cavendish tobacco, and call for a
glass of rum. Now she sat in a low
chair, her hands folded on her lap, quiet,
attentive, gentle in aspect and manner,
despite the bright flash that filled her
eyes each time she raised them. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
thought of yesterday&#8217;s comedy, the queer
resolution that had prompted her, the
histrionic ability that had fooled me.
Were I to write such a story, I thought,
who would believe me? It was one of
those possible things that are incredible.
Ghosts, murders, and bigamies, living
burials, exhumations, and pushing-your-sweetheart&#8217;s-husband-over-precipices,
are
events which happen every moment,
which you may number among the sights
you witness every time you take your
walks abroad, and are therefore fit subjects
for novel-writers to deal with. But
that any young lady, calling herself a
lady, could act&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh! Eugenio!&mdash;thou whom I have
apostrophised so often, and may now
publish thee no myth, but rather my
bosom friend&mdash;thou knowest I am writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
true history; that Theresa <i>did</i> so receive
me; that I <i>did</i> so undeceive her; that
she <i>did</i> drop her nonsense, and become
on a sudden a charming English lady,
whom it was a rapture to look at, and
a joy to listen to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Teazer,&#8221; said I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here I halted, coughed, and said,
&#8220;Have you any objection to my calling
you by this familiar name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. My behaviour yesterday
privileges you to find me an uglier
title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hits her character, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
exclaimed her father. &#8220;I gave it her,
and she shall wear it as long as she
deserves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask you,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;to give me a proof of your pistolling
powers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>&#8220;Make her give up that nonsense,
Charlie,&#8221; remarked my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is harmless enough,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the pistol don&#8217;t burst. That is all
I care about. However, Teazer, since
your fame is concerned&mdash;for I remember
boasting of your dexterity to
Charlie, at Grove End&mdash;go and get
the pistol and show him what you
can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went into the house, and after a
short absence, returned with a pistol case,
and a small worsted ball, to which a
piece of thread was attached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go and hang this up for me
on that rose tree there.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the ball and suspended it to a
branch. She loaded her pistol very scientifically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your white hand,&#8221; said I, &#8220;entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
robs the pistol of its murderous significance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and stand near the tree,&#8221; she
answered, &#8220;and then you&#8217;ll see the thread
cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had sneered at my courage yesterday,
and the wound still bled. That she
might have no further occasion to doubt
my prodigious valour, I took up a position
so close to the tree that, had she suffered
me to remain there, it would have been
ten to one but I had received the ball. She
guessed my motive, and called out laughingly,
&#8220;Not so near: I <i>might</i> hit you!&#8221;</p>

<p>I stalked a few paces away, with a
great air of nonchalance, as if I should
say, &#8220;Pshaw! I am quite used to be
shot at.&#8221; She levelled her pistol. I
looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch the thread,&#8221; she said. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was twenty paces off. I fixed my eyes
on the string-bang! a sharp, clear
report, and down dropped the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She came to the tree, re-affixed the
ball, and, putting the pistol in my hand,
asked me to shoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but you must
keep behind me. Anybody within a
hundred yards either side that tree would
run the fearfullest risk. Winkle was a
neater shot than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>I measured twenty paces, faced the
tree, levelled the pistol, pulled the trigger,
and by heaven! <i>the ball fell!</i></p>

<p>Teazer stared: my uncle clapped his
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a soldier&#8217;s son,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and ought to be able to shoot well.
After that, Teazer, boast no more.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>I was now afraid that Teazer would
challenge me to shoot again. Another
fluke had added another leaf to the
crown I felt sprouting about my brows:
it would be a great blow to have the
growth of that vegetation checked. But
to my delight Theresa returned to her
chair. I rather fancied that she felt
somewhat ashamed of this amusement of
hers. Perhaps because it was now associated
with her conduct of the previous
day; and she would naturally not care
to deal with so direct a reference to her
rudeness.</p>

<p>This exploit of mine naturally persuaded
them that I was a far more accomplished
person than my modesty suffered me to
represent; and of course Theresa was
sure that I could play and sing as well
as I could shoot and ride.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>&#8220;No, on my honour, I can&#8217;t sing a
note.&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle looked incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can play?&#8221; said Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;By ear only,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
tell you what I can do, I can appreciate
fine music and playing when I hear
them, and as I am quite sure you are a
good singer, you ought to oblige me by
teaching me to forget your well-acted
noises of yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only fair,&#8221; exclaimed my uncle.</p>

<p>So saying, he led the way to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I sing?&#8221; asked Teazer,
taking her place at the piano, and this
time not knocking over the music
stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever comes into your head,&#8221; I
answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&#8220;Anything not maudlin,&#8221; said her
father.</p>

<p>She reflected a moment, and then
struck up a very simple, but a very
sweet melody, which she accompanied
with a voice remarkably pure and rich.
Indeed, I never listened to any amateur
whose voice I liked so well, nor to any
song which gave me more pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a very pretty song,&#8221; said I
when she had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Kit Marlow&#8217;s words, &#8216;Come, live
with me,&#8217; set by some eighteenth century
composer,&#8221; exclaimed my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a dreadful struggle it must
have cost you to sing so badly,&#8221; said I,
looking at Theresa with a smile.</p>

<p>She coloured up and asked me if I
knew&mdash;I forget the name of the piece:
one of Chopin&#8217;s, I think. I begged her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to play it; but though she went through
it in dashing style, I can&#8217;t say I was
pleased. It was not music&mdash;there were
no tunes in it. Here and there a little
fragment of melody popped up and provoked
the fingers into giving chase, but
it invariably vanished among the growls
of the bass, or finished with a scream
amid the writhings and chatterings and
shiverings of the treble. I was well
aware that it was one of those pieces
which the musical public pay half-a-guinea
for sofa-stalls to hear, and so I seemed
to applaud. That it was as little to my
uncle&#8217;s taste as mine, I had no doubt;
but then it was his daughter who played
it, and he couldn&#8217;t be captious.</p>

<p>When she rose, he took her place, and
made me laugh heartily over his imitation
of the Italian opera. He was a capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mimic&mdash;struck his breast and clenched his
fist as the basso&mdash;shrugged his shoulders,
and elevated his arm to heaven, as
the tenor&mdash;squeaked and wailed as the
prima donna; and concluded with a duet,
making the oddest noises with his mouth,
in excellent imitation of a violoncello.
This done, he bowed to the room, and
pretended to collect bouquets.</p>

<p>I passed the rest of the evening in
playing double-dummy with him, while
Theresa sat near us, sometimes reading,
but more often watching the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A regular</span> account of my doings during
my stay at uncle Dick&#8217;s house would
be rather wearisome. It would be a
different matter if I had the ability to
make the record as pleasant as the experience.</p>

<p>One or two neighbours were disposed
to be friendly; but unfortunately, they
were people Theresa didn&#8217;t care about.
My kind-hearted uncle appeared to regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the general want of cordiality for my
sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;In other places,&#8221; he said, &#8220;some kind
of fun is always to be got; pic-nics,
lawn-parties, and so forth. But the utmost
civilities we are accustomed to, here,
are sometimes a bow, and at long intervals,
a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I assured him that I wanted no other
and no better society than himself and
his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I should like to have
given a party of some kind for you. But
if I wanted to fill my rooms, I should
have to hunt for my guests in the highways
and under the hedges. There are
not half-a-dozen creatures in the district
to whom I would offer a glass of wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;English society appears to me intolerably
exclusive.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;your self-made
men know that. In the provinces there
is nothing harder to get than society.
A man must live in a place half his life
before he can gather people about him,
and then his antecedents must be unimpeachable.
Provincial society consists of
coteries, all absurdly jealous and suspicious
of intruders. I parted with some
pleasant friends when I left &mdash;&mdash;; but
how many years I shall have to live
here before the people whose acquaintance
is desirable will honour me with their
friendship I cannot imagine. Money will
not bring society, and mere respectability
takes time to make itself known. Nothing
but a title or unquestionable aristocratic
connexions bring people about
you at once. Ah! we&#8217;re a sad set of
toadies in this country; and yet, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
I occasionally grumble, I am satisfied
that society should remain as it is. The
social successes of moneyed interlopers
have done a great deal, since I was a
boy, to demoralise the tone of English
society. The world is lumbered with
parvenus; and though I am a City man
myself, I am conservative enough in my
views of life never to regret any illustration,
on the part of society, of a
resolution to resist the encroachments of
the City.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting into Parliament seems a good
way of getting into society,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great way. I will venture to
say that a third of the members of the
House sit for social, not for political,
aims, of which they know nothing.
However, I never hear of some notorious
company-monger, some rascal the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
magnitude of whose robberies preserves
him from the law, getting into Parliament,
without consoling myself with the
reflection that there is a special constituency
of blackguards in this country
whose interests ought to be represented
as well as those of the honester classes,
and that the swindler, the company-maker,
the Stock Exchange hocusser, are
the right men for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet in spite of my uncle&#8217;s reasoning,
his neighbours were not more to blame
than he was for unsociability. He was
so good-hearted a man, so excellent a
host, so cheerful and amiable a companion,
that he could have found no difficulty
in procuring friends had he made the
effort. In truth, neither he nor his
daughter cared for society. They were
both easily bored, as I noticed once when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
some people called. These people were
fresh from London, and could talk of
nothing but the impertinences of the
season. My uncle laughed at them when
they were gone, and asked me what
manner of sin he should commit in order
to expiate the perpetration of entertaining
such people at his house?</p>

<p>The letter I had written to Conny
remained unanswered. Every hour of the
days that followed, I looked forward to
receiving her answer. Her silence mortified
me. I thought her cruel to neglect
me, knowing what my feelings were.
I pored over her picture, afflicting my
common sense with all manner of silly
questions. She had given me quite
enough encouragement to lead me to
believe that she was very nearly in love
with me, and what I wanted to know was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Was she a flirt? and had she humoured
my passion only to make an ass of
me?</p>

<p>I had confidently reckoned upon receiving
an answer to my letter. Had
her father forbidden her to write? No;
that was improbable. He certainly would
not wish her to treat me with rudeness.
I grew jealous, uneasy, angry. Suppose
all the time she had been allowing me
to make love to her, she was pledged to
Curling, was corresponding with him,
was meeting him! How detestable to be
tricked! How odious to pour your soft
adoration into the ears of a woman who
is laughing in her sleeve at your nonsense,
and thinking, at the very moment
you consider yourself most eloquent, how
much better the other fellow expresses
the same sentiments!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>Lovers can never be ridiculous in each
other&#8217;s eyes, if both are in earnest. But
if one is insincere, then the other is
inevitably absurd. So two mad people
explaining to each other, the one his
claims to the English throne, the other
his claims to the moon as a family
estate, listen with gravity, embrace with
sympathy, and part with mutual admiration.
But a lunatic, talking his
nonsense to a sane man, is pitied and
despised.</p>

<p>Oh, who that has been in love hasn&#8217;t
suffered? Where is he? I would walk
ten miles on the hottest July day to
behold him. I say, it is impossible
to love and not to suffer. Thy goddess
is a divinity hedged about with furze,
and whatever be thy fortune with her,
inevitably art thou bound to carry away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
scars and blisters and wounds. Nay,
madam, I never said that these sufferings,
these agonies, were confined to one sex.
<i>You</i> take your share; <i>you</i>, too, have
your lacerations, your sleepless nights,
your heavy eyelids. There is a Jack
for every Jill&mdash;a Jill for every Jack.
But do your sufferings mitigate ours?
Does Sylvia weeping over Alexis&#8217; cruel
marriage with Phyllis, comfort Ph&#339;bus,
who blubbers over Delia&#8217;s engagement to
Hylas? Oh, this is a vale of tears! let
us silence recrimination&mdash;and weep, if not
in each other&#8217;s arms, at least for one
another.</p>

<p>Nobody knows&mdash;nobody ever will know&mdash;and
nobody had better ask&mdash;how I
suffered (intermittently) whilst I waited
for the letter I never got. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t
care for me!&#8221; I would cry. &#8220;She is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
love with Curling. She has forgotten my
very name. Or worse, she remembers me
only to divert that rascally cashier, whom
she meets, God knows how and where,
with demure travesties of my pretty whispers.&#8221;
And then&mdash;my imagination being
always briskest when I was saddest,
resembling a cat, that is friskiest at
night&mdash;up would spring a vision: Conny
with her sweet, deep eyes, her shining
tresses, her adorable little figure, made
love to by Curling, of the frizzy hair and
pigeon-pie-shaped bosom; watching him
(faugh!) with the divinest meaning in
those eyes, into whose depths I had so
often gazed, and gazed, and gazed, and
still found nothing but a vacuum of
moist and lambent blue! Then, Eugenio,
would I clench my hands, and grind
my teeth; then would I consign Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Curling&#8217;s soul to Mephistopheles, and
hold an Imaginary Conversation with the
faithless one, superior in wit, nature,
satire, and the received beauties, to anything
ever written by Savage Landor; in
which I would now wither her with sarcasms,
and now revive her with splendid
entreaties, now overwhelm her with contempt,
and now restore her with the most
luxuriant tenderness.</p>

<p>Did you never indulge in these mental
strifes? Then you have never been in
love. Who that has been in love has
not morally wrestled with his goddess, as
fanatically as ever Luther wrestled with
the Devil? Don&#8217;t say <i>you trusted her</i>.
Don&#8217;t outrage experience by pretending
that you always had the most unbounded
confidence in her. You know you hadn&#8217;t.
You know when you left her for a week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
that you thought, that day, of the party
she was going; to next evening, of the
men she would meet there, of the
waltzes she would dance there, of the
conservatory she would retire to. Again,
when you were miles away, don&#8217;t you
remember thinking: &#8220;To-day is Lady
Sloper&#8217;s picnic; Aurelia is going; she
will meet that beast Lovall; she will
come home by moonlight in a crowded
vehicle, the beast Lovall at her side,
while her mamma, her only protector,
slumbers a mile behind in the slow
omnibus.&#8221; Pshaw! he that writes this
has gone through it all, and what consolation,
fellow-sufferers, has he to offer
you? Dean Swift said of the weather,
&#8220;I never remember any weather not too
hot or too cold, too wet or too dry;
but, however God Almighty contrives it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
at the end of the year &#8217;tis all very
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>So of love; at the end of the year
&#8217;tis all very well.</p>
